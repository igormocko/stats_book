## Introduction {-}

Simple linear regression is a statistical procedure that models the
relationship between two variables. The two variables are the dependent
variable (DV) called y, and the independent variable (IV), called x.

A statistical model is a simplified picture of the relationship between
variables that emphasizes key features and regular patterns. In simple
linear regression, we model the relationship between two variables as a
straight line.

Why do we build statistical models? It is to be able to explain what is
going on with the dependent variable, and to make predictions about the
future based on data in the past. For example, we can model the
relationship between a person's level of education (x) and salary (y) to
predict how much money they will make -- in fact we could use regression
on this problem and predict how much more people will make for each
additional year of education they have. We can model the durability of a
painted coating (y) based on the thickness of the coating (x). How thick
does the coating have to be to hit our durability target? Statistical
modeling can help with that. Regression in particular is for modeling
linear relationships. Other statistical models exist to model other
kinds of relationships.

The **Regression Model** is a straight line defined by the following
equation:

$$y = \ \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \ \epsilon$$

> where

$${y = the\ dependent\ variable
}{x = the\ independent\ variable
}{\beta_{0} = the\ population\ intercept
}{\beta_{1} = the\ population\ slope\ on\ x,the\ coefficient\ on\ x\ 
}{\epsilon = random\ error
}$$

The regression model describes the relationship between x and y in the
population -- so $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ are **population
parameters.** Since they are population parameters, they are not
directly measured. Rather, we use sample data to estimate these
population values, and draw conclusions about them using statistical
inference, like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.

In regression, a random sample is taken from a population, and the data
in the sample is used to calculate a linear equation, called the
**Estimated Regression Equation (ERE)**:

$$\widehat{y} = b_{0} + b_{1}x$$

$${\text{where\ }\widehat{y} = the\ expected\ or\ predicted\ value\ of\ y\ \left( \text{the\ mean\ of\ y} \right)
}{b_{0} = the\ sample\ intercept;the\ estimate\ of\ \beta_{0}
}{b_{1} = the\ sample\ slope;the\ estimate\ of\ \beta_{1}}$$

The Estimated Regression Equation gives us a way to calculate the
**expected value of y at a given value of x.** The expected value of y
at a given x is **the long-run mean of y: the mean value of y at a given
x if many samples were taken from the same population.** To state this
more formally, $\widehat{y}$ is a point estimate for E(y), the expected
value of y at a given x. It is often called the **predicted value of
y**.

**[A Refresher on the Equation of a Line]{.underline}**

The equation of a line is:

$$y = b + mx$$

$${\text{where\ b} = the\ intercept
}{m = the\ slope\ of\ the\ line}$$

The slope of the line:
$m = \frac{\text{change\ in\ y}}{\text{change\ in\ x}}$

When graphing a line, the vertical axis is the y axis, and the
horizontal axis is the x axis. Hence, the slope is often described as
$m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$ because it describes how much the
line rises up the y axis as it runs along the x axis.

***Example 1: Refresher 1.*** Graph the following equation. What is the
slope? Interpret the slope by stating in words how much y changes (and
in what direction) for a one unit change in x.

$$y = 1 + 0.5x$$

**[And now back to regression...]{.underline}**

Now, data do not typically fall exactly on a nice straight line when
graphed. Real-world data looks more like a cloud of points. Linear
regression can only be used in cases where there is a plausible
straight-line relationship between x and y. If the relationship between
x and y is not linear, then you have to use some other technique to
model it. Scatterplots which graph each data point are an important tool
to recognize the relationships in your data.

Here is how data that would typically be modeled with regression might
look. Can you visualize the line that could model this data? Would it
have a positive or a negative slope?

**Figure 1.**

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

Here is another example of data that could be modeled with linear
regression. Can you visualize the line that could model this data? Would
it have a positive or a negative slope?

**Figure 2.**

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

What about this one?

**Figure 3.**

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

Now let's look at some examples of data you would **NOT** model with
linear regression. Do you see the nonlinear pattern?

**Figure 4.**

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

If you modeled the data in **Figure 4** with linear regression, the
regression procedure would give you a straight line with a positive
slope. But that straight line would misrepresent the actual
relationship, which would cause your predictions to be way off! You as
the researcher are responsible for avoiding this mistake -- no computer
is going to tell you not to make it. (NOTE: there are ways to transform
data like this so that it can be modeled -- if you continue studying
statistics, you will find out about those). For now, protect yourself
against such errors by graphing scatterplots of your data.

**Figure 5.**

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

This is a dangerous pattern, because regression would model this as a
horizontal line, or something close to that. And a horizontal line
(which means the slope is zero) indicates there is **no relationship**
between x and y. But there clearly is a relationship here -- it is just
not a linear relationship.

Let's look at some examples:

$$y = \ \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \ \epsilon$$

The **estimated regression equation (ERE)** is the relationship between
x and y in the sample:

$$\widehat{y} = b_{0} + b_{1}x$$

Remember, $\widehat{y}$ is the **average** $y$ for a given $x$, and is
called the **expected** or **predicted** value of $y$.

***Example 4.*** Regression could be used to investigate the
relationship between weekly sales and weekly advertising.

To use regression to model this relationship, first designate the DV and
the IV.

$${y = Weekly\ Sales\ \left( \$ \right)
}{x = Weekly\ Advertising\ \left( \$ \right)}$$

Then take a random sample of weeks and measure sales and advertising in
the prior week for each. The graph of the data looks like this. Do you
expect a positive or a negative slope on the regression line?:

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

The sample data is used to calculate the following values:

$${Intercept:\ b}_{0} = 267.30$$

$$Slope:b_{1} = 4.51$$

$$95\%\ confidence\ interval\ for\ the\ population\ slope,\ \beta_{1} = \lbrack 3.35,\ 5.66\rbrack$$

a\) Write down the Estimated Regression Equation (ERE).

b\) If \$235 is spent on advertising, what would be the predicted sales?
Interpret this value.

c\) What is the interpretation of the slope, $b_{1}?$

d\) Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the population slope,
$\beta_{1}$

***Example 5.*** The owners of a restaurant think that as the
temperature of a certain drink increases, customer satisfaction will
decrease. A random sample of customers who order this drink is taken,
and the temperature of the drink along with the customer satisfaction
rating (0 to 100) is measured.

To use regression to model this relationship, first we designate the DV
and the IV.

$${y = Customer\ Satisfaction\ Rating
}{x = Temperature\ (℉)}$$

Here is the scatterplot of the data collected:[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

The sample data is used to calculate the following values:

$${{Intercept:\ b}_{0} = 105.2
}{{Slope:\ b}_{1} = \  - 1.42}$$

$$95\%\ confidence\ interval\ for\ the\ population\ slope,\ \beta_{1} = \lbrack - 1.74,\  - 1.09\rbrack$$

a\) Write down the Estimated Regression Equation (ERE)

b\) If the drink is served at $22℉$, what would be the predicted
customer satisfaction score? Interpret this value.

c\) What is the interpretation of the slope, $b_{1}?$

d\) Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the population slope,
$\beta_{1}$


## Hypothesis Testing in Simple Linear Regression {-}

The **Regression Model**,
$\mathbf{y =}\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x + \epsilon}$,
gives the relationship between $\text{x\ }$and $y$ in the
[population]{.underline}. From the sample, regression calculates the
**Estimated Regression Equation**,
$\widehat{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x}$,
which gives the relationship between $\text{x\ }$and $y$ in the
[sample]{.underline}.

**VERY IMPORTANT:**
$\mathbf{\ }\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{\text{\ is\ NOT\ the\ same\ as\ }}\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{\text{\ and\ }}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{\text{\ is\ NOT\ the\ same\ as\ }}\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{!!!!!!}$

You must use hypothesis tests to learn about the $\beta^{'}s$ from the
$b's$

The following table summarizes the possible relationships between
$\text{x\ }$and $y:$

  **Slope Coefficient**          **Relationship between** $\mathbf{\text{x\ }}$**and** $\mathbf{y}$
  ------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------
  $$\text{If\ }\beta_{1} > 0$$   Positive linear relationship in the population
  $$\text{If\ }\beta_{1} < 0$$   Negative linear relationship in the population
  $$\text{If\ }\beta_{1} = 0$$   No relationship in the population

In order to conclude that there [is]{.underline} a relationship between
$\text{x\ }$and $y\ $in the population, we need to confirm that
$\beta_{1} \neq 0$. But we cannot observe the population parameter
$\beta_{1}$ -- we only have the sample statistic $b_{1}.$ How can we
draw conclusions about a population parameter from a sample?? We have to
use good old hypothesis testing!

If the hypothesis test confirms a relationship between x and y, we
typically say that *"the relationship between x and y is statistically
significant,"* or, *"there is a statistically significant relationship
between x and y."*

## Simple Linear Regression: What it all means {-}

Simple linear regression is a statistical modeling procedure that models
the relationship between one Dependent Variable (DV), $y,$ and one
Independent Variable (IV), $\text{x.}$ A model is a simplified
representation that captures important characteristics but leaves out
many details. The model of the relationship between $x$ and
$\text{y\ }$in linear regression is a **straight line**.

The linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ in the whole **population of
interest** is represented in the **Regression Model**:

$$y = \ \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \ \epsilon$$

> where

$${y = the\ dependent\ variable
}{x = the\ independent\ variable
}{\beta_{0} = the\ population\ intercept,\ called\ beta\ nought\ or\ beta\ zero
}{\beta_{1} = the\ slope\ on\ x,the\ coefficient\ on\ x,\ called\ beta\ one
}{\epsilon = random\ error
}$$

The betas are population parameters, and as such, we cannot observe them
directly. Instead, we take a random sample from the population and use
the data from the sample to **estimate** the betas. That is what the
regression procedure does: it analyzes all the data in the sample and
uses it to calculate the **Estimated Regression Equation**:

$$\widehat{y} = b_{0} + b_{1}x$$

$${\text{where\ }\widehat{y} = the\ expected\ or\ predicted\ value\ of\ y\ (the\ mean\ of\ y)\ 
}{b_{0} = the\ sample\ intercept;the\ estimate\ of\ \beta_{0}
}{b_{1} = the\ sample\ slope;the\ estimate\ of\ \beta_{1}}$$

Regression output contains many different quantities, all of which are
calculated from the data: that is, from the individual values of $x$ and
$y$ in the observations in the data set.

The data set will look like this, although the columns do not have to be
in this order:

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| **Observation**      | **Dependent**        | **Independent**      |
|                      |                      |                      |
| **                   | **Variable**         | **Variable**         |
| (**$\mathbf{i}$**)** |                      |                      |
|                      | **(**$\mathbf{y      | **(**$\mathbf{x      |
|                      | }_{\mathbf{i}}$**)** | }_{\mathbf{i}}$**)** |
+======================+======================+======================+
| 1                    | $$y_{1}$$            | $$x_{1}$$            |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| 2                    | $$y_{2}$$            | $$x_{2}$$            |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ...                  | ...                  | ...                  |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| $$n$$                | $$y_{n}$$            | $$x_{n}$$            |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

The Observation column -- which may be labeled by Case or Subject, or
whatever is appropriate for the study -- is a unique identifier for each
observation in the dataset. Every observation in the dataset consists of
measurements for each variable. For example, if this dataset was for a
regression investigating income and years of education, each observation
would be an individual person ($i$), and for each person, income
($y_{i}$) and years of education ($x_{i}$) would be measured and
recorded. From the values of $y_{i}$ and $x_{i}$ for each observation
$i$, we can calculate all of the values in the regression output.

Linear regression calculates the estimated regression equation by
employing something called the **Least Squares Criterion**, which
[minimizes]{.underline} the squared vertical distance between each
observed value of $y$ in the sample (each $y_{i}$) and the predicted $y$
from the estimated regression equation (each ${\widehat{y}}_{i}$) at
every value of $x_{i}$. This vertical distance between observed and
predicted ($y_{i} - {\widehat{y}}_{i}$) is a very important quantity in
regression, called the Residual. Mathematically, the Least Squares
Criterion is stated:

$$Least\ Squares\ Criterion = min\sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - {\widehat{y}}_{i} \right)^{2}$$

So, the Least Squares Criterion minimizes the sum of the squared
residuals. **Conceptually, the estimated regression equation that linear
regression calculates is the line that is as close as possible to all
the points in the data set at once: that is what it means to satisfy the
Least Squares Criterion.**

For linear regression with more than one independent variable, matrix
algebra or calculus is required to calculate the estimated regression
equation. The equations simplify in the case of Simple Linear
Regression, and so we could easily calculate the equation, and in fact
all the regression output, by hand -- if we only had the time.

For now, let's concentrate on learning what the numbers in the
regression output mean.

**[Interpreting Linear Regression Output]{.underline}**

NOTE: in many of the interpretations, I refer to the DV as $y$ and the
IVs as $x,\ x_{1},\ x_{2}\ $etc. When actually interpreting a
regression, these variables have meaning and the meaning should be
substituted in for these placeholder variables.

**[In the *Regression Statistics* table (in order of
importance/informativeness)]{.underline}:**

1)  *The **Coefficient of Determination,
    ***$\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{,\ }$*(called **R Square** in
    Excel) gives the proportion of the variability in the dependent
    variable that is explained by the independent variable or
    variables.* $R^{2}$ *varies from 0 to 1, and when interpreted, it is
    converted to a percentage.*

    a.  *In Simple Linear Regression:* $R^{2}$ *measures the proportion
        of the variability in* $\text{y\ }$*that is explained by* $x$*.*

> *[Example]{.underline}: If* $R^{2} = 0.7231,$ *then the
> **interpretation** is: 72.31% of the variability in* $y$ *is explained
> by* $\text{x.}$

b.  In Multiple Regression: $R^{2}$ *measures the proportion of the
    variability in* $\text{y\ }$*that is explained by all of the
    independent variables,* $x_{1},\ x_{2},\ \ldots,\ x_{p}$*.*

> *[Example]{.underline}: If* $R^{2} = 0.4979,$ *then the
> **interpretation** is: 49.79% of the variability in* $y$ *is explained
> by* $x_{1},\ x_{2},\ldots,\ x_{p}.$

2)  The **Standard Error of the Estimate, s,** often called the **Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, measures the accuracy of the predictions
    made by the Estimated Regression Equation. It is the average
    distance that the observed $y$ values in the sample fall from the
    regression line.

    a.  **Interpretation:** the average error we would make using the
        estimated regression equation to predict $y$. In other words: if
        we used the estimated regression equation to predict $y$, we
        would be off by **s** on average.

> [Example]{.underline}: If $s = 4\ units,$ then the **interpretation**
> is: $4\ units$ *is the average error we would make if we used the
> estimated regression equation to predict* $\text{y.}$
>
> Another way to state the same thing is: *If we used the estimated
> regression equation to predict y, we would be off by 4 units on
> average.*

b.  The Standard Error of the Estimate is in the [same units
    as]{.underline} $y$[,]{.underline} which makes it very easy to
    understand and interpret.

c.  The lower the Standard Error of the Estimate, the more accurate the
    predictions, so the lower the better!

d.  Given two regression models that predict the same DV measured in the
    same units, **the Standard Error of the Estimate can be used to
    choose between models**: **whichever one has the lower Standard
    Error of the Estimate is the better model**, because the predictions
    made with it will be more accurate.

```{=html}

```
3)  **Adjusted**
    $\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{\ (notated\ }\mathbf{R}_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{)}$
    is used as a model comparison statistic in [multiple
    regression]{.underline}. When comparing two models that predict the
    same DV in the same units, the one with the higher **Adjusted**
    $\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$ is the better model.

    a.  NOTE: it is **not** appropriate to use regular old $R^{2}$ to
        compare two models, because adding another IV to a regression
        model will increase $R^{2}$, whether that IV explains anything
        or not. **Adjusted** $\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$**,** on the other
        hand, will only increase if the additional IV adds explanatory
        power, and will actually decrease if it does not.

4)  The **Correlation Coefficient** (called **Multiple R** in Excel) is
    denoted $R_{\text{xy}}$ in simple linear regression and $R_{ŷy}$ *in
    multiple regression. It gives a descriptive measure of the strength
    of the linear association between* $y$ *and* $x$ *(in simple linear
    regression) and between* $y$ *and all the* $x\text{'}s$ *in multiple
    regression.*

    a.  The closer to 1, the stronger the association. Values close to 0
        indicate that x and y are not linearly related.

    b.  No rules are set in stone about what constitutes a "strong" or
        "weak" relationship. A common rule of thumb: \< 0.25: weak
        linear association; between 0.25 and 0.75: moderate linear
        association; \> 0.75: strong linear association

**[The *ANOVA* table:]{.underline}**

-   recall: the sample data is our best representation of the underlying
    population, so if our model is good at predicting the sample values,
    we can infer it will also be good at predicting population values

-   The ANOVA table in the regression output compares two different
    methods of predicting the sample data in an effort to help us decide
    if our regression model is any good.

    -   Premise: there are two alternative models you could use to
        predict $y$. One model includes information about $x$ and one
        does not:

        -   First, you could use the Estimated Regression Equation to
            predict $y$ (in other words, predict ${\widehat{y}}_{i}$
            $\ $at each $x_{i}$)

        -   Second, you could use the next best option, which is to just
            use $\overline{y}$ to predict $y$ (in other words, predict
            $\overline{y}$ (the mean of y) at each $x_{i}$)

            -   This is also called the 'Intercept only model' because
                the equation of $\text{y\ }$does not include any $x$
                variables, thus being only an intercept, and
                representing a horizontal line at $y = \ \overline{y}$.

    -   In the ANOVA table, you calculate the total errors you would
        make if you predicted the actual observed data using each of
        these models, square those errors, and sum them. In this way, we
        can compare the two possible models and decide whether our
        regression model is worth using.

1)  The **Sum of Squares due to Error,**
    $\mathbf{\text{SSE}},\ $sometimes called the **Residual Sum of
    Squares,** is the total amount of prediction error we would make
    using the estimated regression equation to predict the observed
    sample data. It is the sum of the squared **residuals.**

    a.  A **residual** is the **difference between the
        [observed]{.underline} and [predicted]{.underline}**
        $\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{i}}$ **at a given**
        $\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\text{.\ }$In other words:

$$\mathbf{\text{At\ any\ given\ }}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{,\ the\ residual =}\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{-}{\widehat{\mathbf{y}}}_{\mathbf{i}}$$

b.  The $SSE = \sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - {\widehat{y}}_{i} \right)^{2}$,
    and has degrees of freedom $df_{2} = n - p - 1$

c.  Note: the sum of the squared residuals is the quantity that is
    minimized by the Least Squares Criterion!

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2)  The **Total Sum of Squares,** $\mathbf{SST,}\ $is the total amount
    of prediction error we would make if we used $\overline{y}$ (the
    mean of $y_{i}$) to predict the observed sample data.

    a.  The $SST = \sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - \overline{y} \right)^{2}$,
        and has degrees of freedom $df = n - 1$

3)  The **Sum of Squares due to Regression,** $\mathbf{SSR,}$ is how
    much we will reduce prediction error by using the Estimated
    Regression Equation instead of the mean to predict the observed
    sample data.

    a.  The
        $SSR = \sum_{}^{}\left( {\widehat{y}}_{i} - \overline{y} \right)^{2}$,
        and has degrees of freedom $df_{1} = p$

4)  The **Mean Square Error,** $\mathbf{MSE,}$ is the estimate of the
    variance of $\epsilon$. Remember $\epsilon?$ It is the random error
    term in the Regression Model:
    $y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \epsilon$

    a.  The $MSE = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n - p - 1}$

**[\
]{.underline}**

**[The *Coefficients* table:]{.underline}**

1)  The $\mathbf{\text{sample\ slope\ coefficients}}$**,**
    $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{,\ }\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{,\ldots,\ }\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{p}}$
    **,** quantify the magnitude and direction of the relationship
    between each IV and the DV. They are point estimates, respectively,
    of $\beta_{1},\ \beta_{2},\ldots,\ \beta_{p}.$

    a.  In Simple Linear Regression, the **interpretation** **of**
        $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}$ is:

        i.  **If** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{> 0}:$

> *For every one unit increase in* $x$*,* $\text{y\ }$*is predicted to
> increase by* $b_{1}$ *on average.*

ii. **If** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{< 0}:$

> *For every one unit increase in* $x$*,* $\text{y\ }$*is predicted to
> decrease by* $b_{1}$ *on average.*

b.  In Multiple Regression, each slope is interpreted. The
    interpretation for $b_{1}$ is given here, and the interpretation of
    the other slopes follows the same pattern. The **interpretation**
    **of** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}$ is:

    i.  **If** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{> 0}:$

> *For every one unit increase in* $x$*,* $\text{y\ }$*is predicted to
> increase by* $b_{1}$ *on average, holding all other independent
> variables constant.*

ii. **If** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{< 0}:$

> *For every one unit increase in* $x$*,* $\text{y\ }$*is predicted to
> decrease by* $b_{1}$ *on average, holding all other independent
> variables constant.*

2)  The $\mathbf{sample\ intercept,\ }\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{0}},$ is the
    value of $\text{y\ }$when $x = 0.$ This is not always interpretable
    in the context of a given regression. Interpretability depends on
    whether the value $x = 0\ $has substantive meaning.

3)  The
    $\mathbf{\text{confidence\ intervals\ for\ the\ slope\ coefficients}}$**,**
    $\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{,\ }\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{,\ \ldots,\ }\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{p}}$**,**
    and the $\mathbf{intercept,\ }\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{,}$
    are based on the $\alpha$ significance level and are interpreted
    similarly to the other confidence intervals we have encountered:

    a.  For a given **slope coefficient, say**
        $\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{,}$ the **interpretation**
        is:

> *We can be* $\_\_\_\%\ $*confident that the true value of the
> population slope coefficient for* $x_{1}$ *is between \[lower bound\]
> and \[upper bound\].*

b.  For the **intercept,** $\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{0}}$**,** the
    **interpretation** is:

> *We can be* $\_\_\_\%\ $*confident that the true value of the
> population intercept is between \[lower bound\] and \[upper bound\].*

## Simple Linear Regression: An Example {-}

We begin with a **research question** defining what we are investigating
with regression: Does the time students spend on MindTap help explain
(that is to say, predict) their grades?

We will use an $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level for this regression
analysis.

This question defines our variables and the relationship that we are
investigating. Here the variables are:

-   **Dependent variable**: $y = Overall\ MindTap\ Score\ (\%\ points)$

-   **Independent variable**: $x = Time\ spent\ logged\ on\ (hrs)$

The dataset collected is a random sample of $n = 24$ students enrolled
in BA 3400. For each student, time spent logged on to MindTap (in hours)
and overall MindTap score (in points) was recorded. Here is the dataset:

  **Student \#**   **Hours**   **Score**
  ---------------- ----------- -----------
  1                20.85       88.80
  2                10.65       85.40
  3                25.72       99.60
  4                7.75        68.10
  5                18.28       78.40
  6                11.62       75.10
  7                17.30       78.50
  8                15.03       84.30
  9                9.60        77.20
  10               10.93       90.40
  11               14.02       82.20
  12               15.25       91.10
  13               17.72       98.50
  14               9.57        71.90
  15               14.60       86.00
  16               16.45       85.60
  17               6.77        63.00
  18               12.07       85.90
  19               13.00       83.20
  20               22.00       97.30
  21               4.92        81.80
  22               14.67       86.10
  23               22.00       87.00
  24               24.90       90.50

After the data collection step, the next thing to do is to graph a
scatterplot of Scores vs Time Spent. In the scatterplot, we are chiefly
concerned with non-linear patterns -- if we see those, then we cannot
use linear regression to analyze this data. We may also be able to
identify a trend in the data that will give us an idea about the
relationship between these two variables. Here is the scatterplot:

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

Do you see any nonlinear patterns?

Do you see a trend in the data? What sign do you expect on the slope of
the regression line?

At this point, we can run the regression in Excel (Demo). See the next
page for the results!

Using the Regression Output Equations Roadmap, identify $b_{0}$ and
$b_{1}$ on this output. Then write the Estimated Regression Equation
(Remember, the ERE is
$\widehat{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x}$):

Before we can use this equation for prediction or interpret the slope,
we must confirm that there is a statistically significant relationship
between MindTap Score (y) and Time Spent (x) **in the population**.
(Remember, if the slope of a line is zero, then there is no relationship
between x and y. If the slope of a line is a number other than zero,
then there *is* a relationship between x and y.)

Here is the Coefficients Table again:

The sample slope $b_{1}$ is 1.1151 which is definitely not zero... so
that means there is a relationship between Hours and Score, right? Not
necessarily! That sample slope just reflects what is going on in this
sample of 24 students. We have to use this sample slope to prove that
the **population slope** $\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{1}}$ is not zero. If
proven, then that would mean there is a statistically significant
relationship between Hours and Score in the **whole population of BA
3400 students**, not just in these 24 students that were in the sample.
That is what we need to prove before using the regression to explain or
predict anything.

Perform the hypothesis test detailed in **Ch 14: Handout \#2** to
determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship
between Hours and Score in the population:

Now that we have confirmed that Hours and Score are related in the
population, we can use our Estimated Regression Equation (ERE) to
predict student scores, and we can interpret the slope $b_{1}.$

First, let's write down the ERE again:

If 11 hours are spent on MindTap, what is the predicted score? Interpret
this value.

Interpret the slope $b_{1}.$

Report and interpret the confidence interval for the population slope
$\beta_{1}.$ Since we are doing this regression at the $\alpha = 0.01$
significance level, which is a 99% confidence level, we should report
and interpret the 99% confidence interval:

**[But there is more to regression than that...]{.underline}**

The existence of a significant relationship between y and x is a
necessary step -- after all, if you cannot confirm a relationship
between the IV and the DV, then the regression is no good for anything
-- but it is not sufficient to stop there. We need a way to judge the
quality of the model. How well does it fit the data? Does it make
accurate predictions? How much of the variation in y does x explain?
Such questions are answered in the Regression Statistics table. But to
understand the Regression Statistics table, we need to understand how
the regression line (the estimated model) is calculated.

Linear regression calculates the estimated regression equation which
[minimizes]{.underline} the squared vertical distance between each
observed value of $y$ in the sample (each $y_{i}$) and the regression
line, at every value of $x_{i}$ in the dataset. This vertical distance
between **observed and predicted y** is a very important quantity in
regression, called the **Residual** and it is calculated by taking the
difference between the observed and predicted values of y for a given
observation:

$$\text{At\ a\ given\ value\ of\ }x_{i},\ the\mathbf{\ residual =}\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{-}{\widehat{\mathbf{y}}}_{\mathbf{i}}$$

Mathematically speaking, the regression line satisfies the Least Squares
Criterion, which is:

$$Least\ Squares\ Criterion = min\sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - {\widehat{y}}_{i} \right)^{2}$$

So, the regression procedure minimizes the sum of the squared residuals.
**Conceptually, the estimated regression equation that linear regression
calculates is the line that is as close as possible to all the points in
the data set at once: that is what it means to satisfy the Least Squares
Criterion.** The regression line that satisfies the Least Squares
Criterion is called the best-fit line.

Let's calculate some residuals for the MindTap data, to gain insight
into what regression is doing and thereby understand what the output
tells us. Here is part of the MindTap dataset, along with the graph of
the data with the regression line:

Find Student \#3 on the graph. Calculate the residual for this student.

The regression procedure uses the residuals for all 24 students in its
placement of the regression line. It takes all the residuals into
account at once, squares them (why?), sums them, and places the line
where that sum is the smallest it can be. This sum of the squared
residuals is extremely important, then! And that is why it is reported
in the ANOVA table in the regression output. It is called the **Sum of
Squares due to Error** or the **Residual Sum of Squares,** and it is
notated as the **SSE.**

$$\mathbf{\text{SSE}} = \sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - {\widehat{y}}_{i} \right)^{2}$$

$$\text{with\ d}f_{2} = n - p - 1$$

Let's take a look at the ANOVA table from the MindTap regression output.
(Refer to the *Regression Output Equations Roadmap* throughout). Where
is the SSE and its degrees of freedom?

  ANOVA                                               
  ------------ ------ ---------- ---------- --------- ------------------
  * *          *df*   *SS*       *MS*       *F*       *Significance F*
  Regression   1      884.5979   884.5979   20.1839   0.0002
  Residual     22     964.1917   43.8269              
  Total        23     1848.79                         

The other values in the ANOVA table are also important in what we are
building towards -- that is, assessing the quality of this model.

The **Total Sum of Squares,** $\mathbf{SST,}\ $is the total amount of
prediction error we would make if we used $\overline{y}$ (the mean of
$y_{i}$) to predict the observed sample data. Where is the SST and its
*df* in the ANOVA table?

-   The $SST = \sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - \overline{y} \right)^{2}$, and
    has degrees of freedom $df = n - 1$

The **Sum of Squares due to Regression,** $\mathbf{SSR,}$ is how much we
will reduce prediction error by using the Estimated Regression Equation
instead of the mean to predict the observed sample data. Where is the
SSR and its *df* in the ANOVA table?

-   The
    $SSR = \sum_{}^{}\left( {\widehat{y}}_{i} - \overline{y} \right)^{2}$,
    and has degrees of freedom $df_{1} = p$

The **Mean Square Error,** $\mathbf{MSE,}$ is the estimate of the
variance of $\epsilon$. Remember $\epsilon?$ It is the random error term
in the Regression Model: $y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \epsilon$. Where
is the MSE in the ANOVA table?

-   The $MSE = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n - p - 1}$

**[Putting this all together to explain the ANOVA table in
regression:]{.underline}**

-   recall: the sample data is our best representation of the underlying
    population, so if our model is good at predicting the sample values,
    we can infer it will also be good at predicting population values

-   The ANOVA table in the regression output compares two different
    methods of predicting the sample data in an effort to help us assess
    the quality of our regression model. We assess the regression by
    comparing its predictions to the next best alternative

    -   Premise: there are two different models you could use to predict
        $y$. One model includes information about $x$ and one does not:

        -   First, you could use the Estimated Regression Equation to
            predict $y$ (in other words, predict ${\widehat{y}}_{i}$
            $\ $at each $x_{i}$)

        -   Second, you could use the next best option, which is to just
            use the mean of $\overline{y}$ to predict $y$ at each
            $x_{i}$

            -   This is also called the 'Intercept only model' because
                the equation of $\text{y\ }$does not include any $x$
                variables, thus being only an intercept, and
                representing a horizontal line at $y = \ \overline{y}$.

-   The ANOVA table reports the total errors made when predicting the
    actual observed data using each of these models. In this way, we can
    compare the two possible models and decide whether our regression
    model is worth using.

So now that we have more understanding of what is in the ANOVA table, we
should not be surprised to see all of these values showing up in the
Regression Statistics table in the output, which contains the model fit
stats we need.
