## Multinomial Probability Distributions {-}

Goodness of Fit tests are hypothesis tests that determine whether or not
a categorical variable has a particular probability distribution across
its categories.

Goodness-of-Fit tests employ the concept of a **multinomial probability distribution**, 
which is a probability distribution that
gives the probabilities of three or more categorical outcomes. A
multinomial probability distribution for **k** categorical outcomes is
simply a list of probabilities, one per category of the variable, like
this:

<br>
<center>
$p_1 = P_1$ = probability of an outcome being in category 1  
$p_2 = P_2$ = probability of an outcome being in category 2  
$\ldots$  
$p_k = P_k$ = probability of an outcome being in category k  
</center>
<br>

-   Category probabilities ($P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_k$) must always be
    between 0 and 1; that is, $0 \leq P_i \leq 1$. Therefore, if
    probabilities are expressed as percentages in a problem, those
    percentages must be divided by 100 to get probabilities.

-   In a properly formulated multinomial probability distribution, the
    sum of all of the category probabilities is 1.

:::example

**Example 1**  
Suppose you were studying a population of cats at an animal shelter. The
variable you are interested in is color. The cats at the shelter come in
three colors: tabby, black, and calico. 25% of the cats are tabby, 60%
of the cats are black, and 15% of the cats are calico. Construct the
multinomial probability distribution of color for this population.

|  $$i$$  | Category | Probability  |
|:-------:|:--------:|:------------:|
|  1      | Tabby    |              |
|  2      | Black    |              |
|  3      | Calico   |              |  

:::

<br>
A multinomial probability distribution can be used to calculate
**expected frequencies**. **Expected frequencies** are the number of
outcomes per category that we expect to find in a sample drawn from a
population with the given distribution. To calculate the expected
frequencies for a sample of size $n$, use the following equation:

$$e_i = n(P_i)$$

where
<center>
$e_i$ = the expected frequency for the $i^{th}$ category  
$n$ = the sample size  
$P_i$ = the probability of an outcome being in category $i$ 
</center>  

<br>
**NOTE:** Expected frequencies often come out with decimals. You should NOT
round them to whole numbers. Keep them at four decimals unless they come
out even to fewer decimal places.

:::example
**Example 2**

Consider the multinomial probability distribution from Example 1. What
are the expected frequencies for a random sample of size 50 drawn from
this population? In other words, how many cats in the sample are
expected to be tabby, how many black, and how many calico,
theoretically?

|                |             | $$P_i$$         | Frequency       |

## Goodness-of-Fit Test for a Single Categorical Variable {-}

Goodness-of-Fit tests test whether or not a categorical variable fits a
particular multinomial probability distribution. A multinomial
probability distribution gives the probabilities for three or more
categorical outcomes of a given variable. The multinomial probability
distribution for a variable with $k$ categorical outcomes is:

<br>
<center>
$p_1 = P_1$ = probability of an outcome being in category 1  
$p_2 = P_2$ = probability of an outcome being in category 2  
$\ldots$  
$p_k = P_k$ = probability of an outcome being in category k  
</center><br>

where
<center>
$P_1, P_2,\ldots,P_k$ are probabilities between 0 and 1  
$k$ = the number of categories in the variable
</center>

<br>

### 1. Formulating the Hypotheses {-}
There is only one set
of hypotheses for goodness-of-fit tests, and it incorporates a
multinomial probability distribution. You **must fill in the probabilities** 
$(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_k)$ for each problem.

<br>

| **Hypotheses for Goodness-of-Fit Tests** |
|:----------------------------------------:|
| $H_0$ : The probability distribution is $\mathbf{p_1} = P_1, \mathbf{p_2} = P_2, ..., \mathbf{p_k} = P_k$ <br> $H_A$ : The probability distribution is NOT $\mathbf{p_1} = P_1, \mathbf{p_2} = P_2, ..., \mathbf{p_k} = P_k$ |
| **Answers questions about:** |
| If the population distribution of a given categorical variable fits $\mathbf{p_1} = P_1, \mathbf{p_2} = P_2, ..., \mathbf{p_k} = P_k$ or not. |

**NOTES:**  
1. $P_1, P_2, ..., P_k$ are probabilities between 0 and 1
2. $k$ = the number of categories

<br>

### 2. The Test Statistics {-}
Here is the idea behind Goodness of Fit tests: if the null hypothesis
is true, then the multinomial probability distribution in
$H_0$ truly describes the population. This means that the observed
frequencies from the sample should be the same as (or very close to)
the expected frequencies calculated from the $H_0$ probability
distribution. (For example, if 25% of the population fits into
Category A, then about 25% of the sample should fit into Category A.)
Large differences between the observed frequencies and the expected
frequencies are evidence that the underlying population is NOT
distributed according to the hypothetical multinomial probability
distribution.

Some variation between observed and expected frequencies will occur
due to random chance, so we need to use our hypothesis testing
techniques to see if the differences we see are *statistically
significant.* The $\alpha$ significance level sets a threshold at
which we determine the sample distribution to be different enough from
what we would expect under the null hypothesis, to contradict the null
hypothesis.

The size of the difference between the observed and expected
frequencies is quantified in our $\chi^2$ test statistic. When the
test statistic is large enough to reject the null, we can conclude
that the population is not distributed according to the hypothetical
multinomial probability distribution.

The test statistic for a Goodness-of-Fit Test is:

$$\chi_{test}^{2} = \sum_{i = 1}^{k}\frac{\left(f_{i} - e_{i}\right)^{2}}{e_{i}}$$

where
<center>
$e_i = nP_i$ = the expected frequency for category i  
$f_i$ = the observed sample frequency for category i  
$k$ = the number of categories  
$n$ = sample size 
</center>
and
<center>
the degrees of freedom are $df = k - 1$
</center>


### 3.  Deciding whether or not to reject $\mathbf{H_0}$ {-}

Only large discrepancies between the observed and expected frequencies
constitute evidence against the null hypothesis, so all
Goodness-of-Fit tests are **Upper Tail.** (If the
test statistic was in the lower tail, that would mean there were only
small discrepancies between observed and expected).

<br>

<center> **When to Reject $H_0$ in a Goodness-of-Fit Test**
</center>


| | **Always an Upper Tail Test** |
|-|--|
| **p-value approach** | Calculate the upper tail p-value of $\chi_{test}^{2}$ <br><br> If the p-value $\leq \alpha$, then reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br> If the p-value $> \alpha$, then do not reject $H_0$. $H_A$ is unsupported. |
| **CV approach**  | Look up the UT Critical Value of $\chi^2$, which is $\chi_{\alpha,UT}^2$ <br><br> If $\chi_{test}^2 \geq \chi_{\alpha,UT}^2$, then reject $H_{0}$ and accept $H_A$. <br> If $\chi_{test}^2 < \chi_{\alpha,UT}^2$, then do not reject $H_0$. $H_A$ is unsupported.      

**NOTES:**  
1. $\chi_{test}^2$ is a Test Statistic  
2. $\chi_{\alpha,UT}^2$ is an Upper Tail Critical Value
3. $\chi^2$ is based on degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom in Goodness of Fit Tests is 
$df = k - 1$ where $k$ is the number of categories
  
<br>

### 4. Interpreting the Test {-}

(Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis
tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the
parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the
answer to that question. In other words, we must *interpret* the
conclusion of our test in terms of the original question.

Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null
hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you
reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given
$\alpha$ level of significance you may conclude that $H_{A}$ is true.
If you do not reject $H_{0},\ $then you must conclude that $H_{A}$ is
unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how
to *interpret* hypothesis tests: **always look to the alternative
hypothesis!**

In all that follows, you must substitute the actual words and numbers
from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each
interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and
says either that we can or cannot conclude that it is true.

<br>

<center> **How to Interpret a Goodness-of-Fit Test**
</center>

| **When you** | **Interpretation** | 
|:---:|-----|
| **Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that the probability distribution of *the variable* is NOT $p_1 = P_1, p_2 = P_2, ..., p_k = P_k$. |
| **Do not reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that the probability distribution of *the variable* is different from $p_1 = P_1, p_2 = P_2, ..., p_k = P_k$. |
    
    
**NOTES:**    
1. When $H_0$  is rejected, you can then look at the distribution of outcomes in the sample for information about the true population distribution.  
2. Comparing the expected frequencies to the observed frequencies is often helpful to learn about how the actual distribution differs from the $H_0$ distribution.


### Assumptions Underlying These Hypothesis Tests {-}
All hypothesis tests use sampling distributions to determine the
probability of sample statistics. In order for us to be confident that
our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way
the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If
the assumptions are not met -- that is, if any given assumption is not
true -- then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They
may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the
wrong conclusions.

For Goodness-of-Fit Tests, the only assumption that must be satisfied is
that the expected frequency for each category must be greater than five:

$$e_{i} \geq 5$$
<br>

**Exercise**  
A bike shop sells bikes with frames made from four different
materials: carbon fiber, aluminum, steel, and titanium. In the past, the
share of sales by type of frame was 17% carbon fiber, 53% aluminum, 12%
steel, and 18% titanium. The bike shop decided to use a Goodness-of-Fit
test at the $\alpha = 0.05}$ **significance level** to see
whether the probability of sales by frame type has changed from what it
was in the past. In a random sample of 250 bike sales, the following
frequencies were observed:

  **Category**   **Frame Type**   **Number of bikes sold**
  -------------- ---------------- --------------------------
  1              Carbon Fiber     66
  2              Aluminum         128
  3              Steel            16
  4              Titanium         40

Start by formulating the null and alternative hypotheses:

From the null hypothesis, fill in the Hypothesized Probability column.

From the sample data, fill in the Observed Frequency column.

For each row, the Expected Frequency is
$e_{i} = n\left(P_{i}\right)$.

The sum of the values in the last column is the $\chi^{2}$ test
statistic. The test statistic and the critical value have *k* -- 1
degrees of freedom, where *k* is the number of categories.

Now you are ready to complete the hypothesis test.

Because we have determined that the distribution has changed from what
it was in the past, the bike shop now wants more details. Which
categories have seen the biggest changes? What adjustments should be
made to inventory?

## Test of Independence for Two Categorical Variables {-}

Tests of Independence show whether or not there is a relationship
between two categorical variables measured on the same population.

If two categorical variables are:

- **independent** of one another, the two variables are **not related**

- **not independent** of one another, the two variables
  are **related** (i.e. dependent)


### 1. Formulating the Hypotheses {-}

The default assumption, which forms the null hypothesis in this type
of test, is that the two variables are independent of one another. If
you can reject the null hypothesis, that means the two variables are
related.

There is only one set of hypotheses for tests of independence. The two
categorical variables are ***Variable 1*** and ***Variable 2***, and
you should fill in what those variables are in the context of the
problem when doing a test of independence. It doesn't matter which one
is which, but you must maintain consistency in labeling throughout the
problem.

<br>

| **Hypotheses for Tests of Independence** |
|:----------------------------------------:|
| $H_0$ : *Variable 1* is independent of *Variable 2* <br> $H_A$ : *Variable 1* is not independent of *Variable 2* |
| **Answers questions about:** |
| Whether or not *Variable 1* is related to *Variable 2* |

**NOTE:**  
*Variable 1* and *Variable 2* must both be categorical variables

<br>

### 2. The Test Statistics {-}

The logic is the similar to a Goodness of Fit test. The expected
frequencies are the counts we expect to get for each joint category in
the sample if the two variables are independent (that is, if the null
hypothesis is true). Observed frequencies are the actual frequencies
in the random sample. Some variation between observed and expected
frequencies will occur due to random chance, so we use our hypothesis
testing techniques and set a threshold (the
$\alpha$ significance level) at which we consider the differences
between observed and expected counts to be large enough to contradict
the null hypothesis. If the differences between the expected and
observed frequencies are large, then the sample contradicts the null
hypothesis and it is rejected, with the conclusion that $H_A$ is
true: the variables are not independent.

The size of the difference between the observed and expected
frequencies is quantified in our $\chi^2\ $test statistic, which is
calculated according to this formula:

$$\chi_{test}^2 = \sum_{i}^{}{\sum_{j}^{}\frac{\left( f_{ij} - e_{ij} \right)^2}{e_{ij}}}$$

where
<center>
$f_{ij}$ = the observed frequencies from the sample  
$e_{ij}$ = the expected frequencies if the variables are independent
</center>
and
<center>
the degrees of freedom are $df = (r - 1)(c - 1)$  
$r$ = the number of categories in *Variable 1*  
$c$ = the number of categories in *Variable 2*
</center>

<br>
We will use a contingency table with $i$ rows and $\text{j\ }$columns
to begin our calculation of this test statistic.

### 3.  Deciding whether or not to reject $H_0$ {-}

Only large differences between the observed and expected frequencies
constitute evidence against the null hypothesis, so all Tests of
Independence are **upper tail tests**.

The two possible decisions are:

1.  Reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$
2.  Do not reject $H_0$ and conclude that $H_A$ is unsupported.

REMINDER: you can never *accept* the null hypothesis. Remember the
swans.

<br>

<center> **When to Reject $H_0$ in Tests of Independence**
</center>


| | **Always an Upper Tail Test** |
|-|--|
| **p-value approach** | Calculate the upper tail p-value of $\chi_{test}^{2}$ <br><br> If the p-value $\leq \alpha$, then reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br> If the p-value $> \alpha$, then do not reject $H_0$. $H_A$ is unsupported. |
| **CV approach**  | Look up the UT Critical Value of $\chi^2$, which is $\chi_{\alpha,UT}^2$ <br><br> If $\chi_{test}^2 \geq \chi_{\alpha,UT}^2$, then reject $H_{0}$ and accept $H_A$. <br> If $\chi_{test}^2 < \chi_{\alpha,UT}^2$, then do not reject $H_0$. $H_A$ is unsupported.      

**NOTES:**  
1. $\chi_{test}^2$ is a Test Statistic  
2. $\chi_{\alpha,UT}^2$ is an Upper Tail Critical Value
3. $\chi^2$ is based on degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom in Tests of Independence is $df = (r-1)(c-1)$  where $r$ is the number of categories in *Variable 1* and $c$ is the number of categories in *Variable 2*.

<br>

### 4. Interpreting the Test {-}

(Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis
tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the
parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the
answer to that question. In other words, we must *interpret* the
conclusion of our test in terms of the original question.

Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null
hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you
reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given
$\alpha$ level of significance you may conclude that $H_A$ is true.
If you do not reject $H_0$, then you must conclude that $H_A$ is
unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how
to *interpret* hypothesis tests: **always look to the alternative hypothesis!**

In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers
from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each
interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and
says either that it is true or that it is unsupported by the evidence.

<br>
<center> **How to Interpret a Goodness-of-Fit Test**
</center>

| **When you** | **Interpretation** | 
|:---:|-----|
| **Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that *Variable 1* is not independent of *Variable 2*. *Variable 1* and *Variable 2* are related. |
| **Do not reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that *Variable 1* and *Variable 2* are related. |
    
    
**NOTES:**    
When $H_0$  is rejected, you can:  
1) look at the distribution of outcomes in the sample for information about the relationship between *Variable 1* and *Variable 2*  
2) compare the expected frequencies to the observed frequencies to learn about how the two variables are related.

<br>

**[Assumptions Underlying These Hypothesis Tests]{.underline}**

All hypothesis tests use sampling distributions to determine the
probability of sample statistics. In order for us to be confident that
our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way
the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If
the assumptions are not met -- that is, if any given assumption is not
true -- then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They
may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the
wrong conclusions.

For Tests of Independence, the only assumption that must be satisfied is
that the expected frequency for each combination of categories must be
greater than five:

$$e_{\text{ij}} \geq 5$$

*Exercise.* An analyst for a chain of coffee shops suspects that a
customer's drink choice is related to the time of day when the customer
comes in. The three drink choices the analyst would like to consider are
Hot Coffee, Iced Coffee, and Specialty Drinks. The analyst takes a
random sample of 503 customers and then splits the customers into two
groups: those who came in before 11am and those who came in after 11am.
Of the customers who came in before 11am, 90 ordered Hot Coffee, 79
ordered Iced Coffee, and 72 ordered Specialty Drinks. Of the customers
who came in after 11am, 67 ordered Hot Coffee, 74 ordered Iced Coffee,
and 121 ordered Specialty Drinks.

Conduct a Test of Independence to find out whether drink choice is
related to time of visit at the α = .01 significance level.

[First]{.underline}, fill in the Observed Frequencies from the sample
data, then calculate the Row and Column Totals.

[Second]{.underline}, calculate the expected frequency, $e_{\text{ij}}$,
for each combination of categories:

$$e_{\text{ij}} = \ \frac{(Row\ i\ Total)(Column\ j\ Total)}{n}$$

where *i* is the row number, *j* is the column number, and n is the
sample size.

NOTE: there are three categories of Drink Choice, so r = 3. There are
two categories of Time of Day, so c = 2. You will need this information
later to calculate degrees of freedom for the $\chi^{2}$ test statistic
and critical value.

[Third]{.underline}, fill in the following table. The sum of the last
column is the $\chi_{\text{test}}^{2}$ test statistic:

The $\chi^{2}$ test statistic and critical value for a test of
independence has (r -- 1)(c -- 1) degrees of freedom (see note from
previous page). Now you are ready to complete your hypothesis test.
