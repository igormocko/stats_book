## Hypothesis Testing: The Process {-}

A [hypothesis test]{.underline} occurs in stages.

The logic of hypothesis testing is as follows:

1)  Identify a population of interest, a parameter of interest, and a
    question you have about that parameter

2)  Make an assumption about the value of the population parameter you
    are interested in

3)  Examine a random sample from the population to see if it contradicts
    that assumption

4)  If the sample contradicts the assumption, then reject the
    assumption. Otherwise, do not reject the assumption. (NOTE: you can
    never prove that the assumption is true in a hypothesis test -- you
    can only prove that it is wrong. Hence: "Reject," or "Do not
    reject")

5)  Answer the original question.

In practice, these are the steps in a **hypothesis test**, in which you
use a sample to infer information about the value of a population
parameter:

1)  **Formulate a null hypothesis**
    $\mathbf{(}\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{)}$ **and an alternative
    hypothesis** $\mathbf{(}\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{)}$ according
    to the question you want to answer about the population parameter of
    interest. The null hypothesis is an assumption about the value of
    the population parameter; the alternative hypothesis is the
    mathematical opposite of the null hypothesis.

2)  **Calculate the Test-Statistic.** In this step, you standardize
    information from the sample against the appropriate sampling
    distribution.

3)  **Decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis.** Determine
    the probability of getting that Test-Statistic (in other words, that
    sample), assuming that the null hypothesis is true. If the
    probability is less than the $\alpha$ significance level, then
    reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
    Otherwise, do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the
    alternative hypothesis is unsupported.

4)  **Interpret the hypothesis test** in order to answer the original
    question.

## Hypothesis Tests about a Single Population Mean {-}

### 1. Formulating the Hypotheses {-}

The three possible forms of hypotheses each correspond to a different question you
might want to ask about the true value of the population mean, $\mu$.  
**Note:** in each of the hypotheses below, $\mu_0$ is a number. It is the hypothesized value of $\mu$.

<br>


<center> **Hypotheses for Hypothesis Tests about a Single Population Mean** $\mathbf{\mu}$ 
</center>

| **Lower Tail Test** | **Upper Tail Test** | **Two-Tailed Test** |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| $H_0:\mu \geq \mu_0$ <br> $H_A: \mu < \mu_0$ | $H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0$ <br> $H_A: \mu > \mu_0$ | $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ <br> $H_A: \mu \neq \mu_0$ |
|| Answers questions about ||
| If the true population mean, $\mu,$ is less than a given number, $\mu_0$ | If the true population mean, $\mu,$ is greater than a given number, $\mu_0$ | If the true population mean, $\mu,$ is different from a given number, $\mu_0$ |

<br>



+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ***Example*** Suppose you want to know whether a population mean is  |
| more than 3. That matches with the question answered by an upper     |
| tail test with a $\mu_{0}$ of 3. So, the hypotheses would be:        |
|                                                                      |
| $$H_0: \mu \leq 3$$                                                  |
| $$H_A: \mu > 3$$                                                     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Upper Tail and Lower Tail Tests are called **one-tailed** or
**directional** tests. Two-tailed tests are called **non-directional**
tests.

<br>

### 2. Calculate the Test Statistic {-}
In this step, we calculate a test statistic from the sample information. The test
statistic standardizes the sample, so we can use it to judge our
hypotheses. In the case of testing a population mean, there is an
additional preliminary step: we have to choose the correct test
statistic to use.

Every hypothesis test incorporates some information about the
variability of the underlying population -- otherwise it would be
impossible to determine how probable a given sample statistic really
is. For hypothesis testing about a single population mean, the correct
choice of test statistic depends on the sampling distribution of
$\overline{x}$, which in turn depends on what information you have
about the variability in the underlying population.

While the population standard deviation, $\sigma$, cannot strictly be
known without measuring the entire population and calculating it,
sometimes we can *assume* we know the true value of $\sigma$, The
basis for such an assumption would come from prior knowledge,
historical information, or past experience with the population in
question.

Other times, we might not have knowledge of $\sigma$. In that case, we
can still get some idea about the variability of the underlying
population by looking at the standard deviation, $s$, of a random
sample taken from that population. After all, a random sample is
representative of the population it comes from, so the amount of
variability in the population ought to be reflected in the amount of
variability in the sample. If we cannot assume we know $\sigma$, then
$s$ is our best *estimate* of the variability in the
population. **NOTE:** $s$ is a measurement on the sample -- we calculate it
from the sample data.

In summary: The **population standard deviation,** $\sigma$, is
sometimes assumed to be known from prior knowledge, historical
information, or past experience. On the other hand, if $\sigma$ is
unknown, then the only information about variability in the underlying
population is the standard deviation measured on the sample itself --
the **sample standard deviation**, $s$. In hypothesis testing about a
single population mean, it will be your task to carefully identify
whether the standard deviation in a given problem refers to a sample
or to the population. That will determine which test statistic to use.

**When $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is KNOWN**

Under the assumption that $H_0$ is true as an equality, the sampling
distribution of the sample mean, $\overline{x}$, follows the $z$
distribution. Therefore, we standardize the sample against the $z$
distribution by calculating the following $z$ test statistic:
<br>

$$z_{test} = \frac{\overline{x}-\mu_0}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

where  
<center>
$\overline{x}$ = the sample mean   
$\mu_0$ = the hypothesized value of $\mu$  
$\sigma$ = the population standard deviation  
$n$ = the sample size  
</center>
<br>
**NOTE:** when calculating this equation, evaluate the numerator and
denominator separately, and then divide
<br>

**When $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is UNKNOWN, we use $s$ instead** 

Under the assumption that $H_0$ is true as an equality, the sampling
distribution of the sample mean, $\overline{x}$, follows the $t$
distribution with $degrees\ of\ freedom = n - 1$. Therefore, we
standardize the sample against the $t$ distribution by calculating the
following $t$ test statistic:
<br>

$$t_{test} = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

where
<center>
$\overline{x}$ = the sample mean  
$\mu_0$ = the value that $\mu$ is being compared to (from the hypotheses)  
$s$ = the sample standard deviation  
$n$ = the sample size  
and the degrees of freedom = $n - 1$  
</center>
<br>
**NOTE:** when calculating this equation, evaluate the numerator and
denominator separately, and then divide

<br>

### 3.  Deciding whether to reject $\mathbf{H_0}$ or not {-}
There are two approaches to deciding whether or not to reject the Null:

* In the ***p-value approach***, we **compare** the **p-value** of our
  test statistic to the $\mathbf{\alpha}$ **significance level** and
  reject $H_{0}$ if the p-value is less than or equal to the $\alpha$
  significance level.

* In the ***critical value approach***, we **compare** the **test
  statistic** to **a critical value** -- this can be done with a
  diagram in which we use the critical value(s) to construct a
  rejection region or regions; if the test statistic is in a rejection
  region, we reject $H_{0}$ and accept $H_{A}.$ Or, this step can be
  accomplished by following the mathematical rules given in the tables
  below.

<br>

<center> **When to Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$ for z-test statistics**
</center>

|  | **For a Lower Tail Test** | **For an Upper Tail Test** | **For a Two-Tail Test** |
|:-:|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **p-value approach** | Look up the LT p-value of $z_{test}$ <br><br> If the LT p-value $\leq \alpha$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If the LT p-value > $\alpha$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. | Look up the UT p-value of $z_{test}$ <br><br> If the UT p-value $\leq \alpha$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If the UT p-value > $\alpha$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. | The two-tailed p-value is two times the one tailed p-value of $z_{test}$. <br><br> If the 2T p-value $\leq \alpha$,  reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If the 2T p-value > $\alpha$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. |
| **CV approach** | If $z_{test} \leq -z_{\alpha}$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If $z_{test} > -z_{\alpha}$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. | If $z_{test} \geq z_{\alpha}$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If $z_{test} < z_{\alpha}$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. | If $z_{test} \leq -z_{\alpha/2}$ OR $z_{test} \geq z_{\alpha/2}$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If $-z_{\alpha/2} < z_{test} < z_{\alpha/2}$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. |

**NOTES:**  
  1. $z_{test}$ is the Test Statistic  
  2. $z_{\alpha}, -z_{\alpha}, and\ z_{\alpha/2}$ are Critical Values

**NOTES:**  
  1. $t_{test}$ is the Test Statistic  
  2. $t_{\alpha}, -t_{\alpha}, and\ t_{\alpha/2}$ are Critical Values  
  3. The correct t distribution to use when determining the p-value or the Critical Value depends on the degrees of freedom.


### 4. Interpreting the Test {-}
    
**Note:** This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis
tests.   
We start every hypothesis test with a question about the
parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the
answer to that question. In other words, we must *interpret* the
conclusion of our test in terms of the original question.
    
Remember: in hypothesis testing **you can never prove the null
hypothesis**. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: that is,
when you reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your
given $\alpha$ level of significance you can conclude that $H_{A}$ is
true. If you do reject $H_{0},\ $then you must conclude that $H_{A}$
is unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for
how to *interpret* hypothesis tests: *always look to the alternative
hypothesis!* Restate $H_{A}$ in words, and say whether or not you can
conclude that it is true.
    
In the table that follows, you would substitute the actual words and
numbers from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each
interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and
says either that we can or cannot conclude it is true.

|:--:|----|----|----|
| **Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conlude that $\mu$ is less than $\mu_0$. | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that $\mu$ is greater than $\mu_0$. | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that $\mu$ is different than $\mu_0$. |
| **Do not reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that $\mu$ is less than $\mu_0$. | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conlcude that $\mu$ is greater than $\mu_0$. | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that $\mu$ is different than $\mu_0$. |
    
    
**NOTES:**    
  1. $\mu$ is the true value of the population mean  
  2. $\mu_0$ is a number that is the hypothesized value of $\mu$
    


## Hypothesis Tests about a Single Population Proportion {-}


### 1. Formulating the Hypotheses {-}
The three possible
forms of hypotheses each correspond to a different question you
might want to ask about the true value of a population proportion,
$p$. It is important to remember that a proportion is a
number between 0 and 1. Proportions are often expressed in words as
percentages, fractions, or shares. These must be converted into
proportions before being using in hypothesis tests (See the Chapter
9 handout on proportions).

**Note:** in each of the hypotheses, $p_0$ is a number. It is the hypothesized values of $p$.
<br>
<center> **Hypotheses for Hypothesis Tests about a Single Population Mean** $\mathbf{\mu}$ 
</center>

| **Lower Tail Test** | **Upper Tail Test** | **Two-Tailed Test** |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| $H_0:p \geq p_0$ <br> $H_A: p < p_0$ | $H_0: p \leq p_0$ <br> $H_A: p > p_0$ | $H_0: p = p_0$ <br> $H_A: p \neq p_0$ |
|| Answers questions about ||
| If the true population proportion, $p,$ is less than a given number, $p_0$ | If the true population proportion, $p,$ is greater than a given number, $p_0$ | If the true population proportion, $p,$ is different from a given number, $p_0$ |

<br>

> ***Example*** Suppose you want to know whether a population proportion has decreased from 0.25. That matches with the question answered by a lower tail test with a p_0 of 0.25. So, the hypotheses would be:  
$$H_0: p \geq 0.25$$
$$H_A: p < 0.25$$

<br>

Once again, Upper Tail and Lower Tail Tests are called **one-tailed** or
**directional** tests. Two-tailed tests are called **non-directional**
tests.

### 2. Calculating the Test Statistic {-}

Under the assumption that $H_{0}$ is true as an equality, the sampling
distribution of the sample proportion, $\overline{p}$, is the $z$
distribution. Therefore, we have to standardize the sample information
against the $z$ distribution by calculating the following $z$ test
statistic:

<br>
$$z_{test} = \frac{\overline{p} - p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0\left(1 - p_0\right)}{n}}}$$
where  
<center>
$\overline{p}$ = the sample proportion   
$p_0$ = the hypothesized value of $p$  
$n$ = the sample size  
</center>
<br>
**NOTE:** when calculating this equation, evaluate the numerator and
denominator separately, and then divide
<br>

### 3. Deciding whether to reject $\mathbf{H_0}$ or not {-}
The rules are the same as the rules given above in the table labeled **"When to
Reject** $\mathbf{H_0}$ **for** $\mathbf{z}$ **test statistics."**

### 4. Interpreting the Test {-}

Remember, in this step: *always look to the alternative hypothesis!*

In the table that follows, you would substitute the actual words and
numbers from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each
interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and
says either that we can or cannot conclude it is true.

**NOTES:**    
  1. $p$ is the true value of the population mean  
  2. $p_0$ is a number that is the hypothesized value of $p$
  


### Assumptions Underlying These Hypothesis Tests {-}

All hypothesis tests use sampling distributions to determine the
probability of sample statistics. In order for us to be confident that
our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way
the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met.
(Note: these are separate from the assumption we make in the null
hypothesis. We should only formulate a null hypothesis once these
assumptions are met). If the assumptions are not met -- that is, if any
given assumption is not true -- then we cannot rely on the results of
the hypothesis tests. They may mislead us, give us the wrong answers,
and cause us to draw the wrong conclusions.

-   **For hypothesis tests about a single population mean,** $\mathbf{\mu}$:
    -   If the population is normally distributed, then the sample size
        can be small

    -   If the population is not normally distributed, or if the
        distribution is unknown, then the sample size must be greater
        than or equal to 30 $(n \geq 30)$

    -   When $\sigma$ is unknown (that is, when you are using the t
        distribution), the t test works even with small sample sizes.
        However, if the population has a skewed distribution or has
        outliers, then the sample size must be greater than 50
        $(n \geq 50)$

-   **For hypothesis tests about a single population proportion** $\mathbf{p}$:
    -   The following condition must hold true:

$$np_0 \geq 5\ and\ n(1 - p_0) \geq 5$$
<center>
where  
$n$ = sample size  
$p_0$ = the hypothesized value of $p$ from $H_0$ and $H_A$
</center>

## Exercise: Formulating the Null and Alternative Hypotheses {-}

IMPORTANT: Hypotheses are *always* about **population parameters.** 
They are *never* about sample statistics, so
if you write the notation for a sample statistic in a pair of
hypotheses, that will be a signal you have done something wrong.

___


First, let's practice some basics, referring back to **Step \#1:
Formulating the Hypotheses** in Part 1 of *Ch9: Handout \#2*.

*Example 1.* Write the hypotheses for a **lower tail test** for a single
population mean if $\mu_{0}$ is $1500$.

*Example 2.* Write the hypotheses for an **upper tail test** for a
single population mean if $\mu_{0}$ is $- 17.$

*Example 3.* Write the hypotheses for a **two-tailed test** for a single
population mean if $\mu_{0}$ is $752.$

    **Now, try it yourself:**

*Exercise 1.* Write the hypotheses for an **upper tail test** for a
single population mean if $\mu_{0}$ is $22$

*Exercise 2.* Write the hypotheses for a **lower tail test** for a
single population mean if $\mu_{0}$ is $- 45$.

*Exercise 3.* Write the hypotheses for a **two-tailed test** for a
single population mean if $\mu_{0}$ is $12,383.$

Now, let's build on that. To determine which tail test to choose, you
have to match up the question you have about the population mean with
the hypotheses that are the best fit to answer the question. Since you
can only prove the Alternative Hypothesis ($H_{A}$), and you cannot ever
prove the null hypothesis ($H_{0}$), it is usually helpful to frame your
question in terms of the alternative hypothesis. What I mean by that is,
you can read each $H_{A}$ aloud in words, and see which one fits the
circumstances best.

*Example 4.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine
whether a population mean is smaller than 14.

*Example 5.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine
whether a population mean is different than 419.

*Example 6.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine
whether a population mean has increased from 85.

**Now, try it yourself:**

*Exercise 4.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to
determine whether a population mean has decreased from 581.

*Exercise 5.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to
determine whether a population mean has changed from 74.

*Exercise 6.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to
determine whether a population mean is higher than 620.

Now let's apply what we've learned to actual hypothesis testing
scenarios.

In order to properly formulate the Null Hypothesis ($H_{0}$) and the
Alternative Hypothesis ($H_{A}$), you must:

1)  Identify the parameter of interest
2)  Identify the question being asked about the parameter of interest
        and match it to an LT, UT, or 2T test

*Example 7:*

A shampoo company has introduced a new formula of a particular shampoo.
In the past, customers have been regularly surveyed about the shampoo,
asked to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 10, and the shampoo has
scored a mean of 6.2.

An analyst at the company would like to test whether the mean
satisfaction score changed after the new formula was introduced.
Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses the analyst should use.

1)  The parameter of interest is $\mu:\ $the population mean customer
    satisfaction score

2)  The question being asked is: has the mean customer satisfaction
    score changed from what it was before the new formula was introduced
    (which was 6.2)?

The hypotheses will refer to $\mu$ which is the population mean customer
satisfaction score. The analyst wants to test for any change from 6.2 --
if the mean score has changed, then it would be different from (i.e. not
equal to) 6.2. Therefore, the proper hypotheses are:

$H_{0}:\ $
$H_{A}:\ $

*Example 8*:

The same situation as Example 1, except this time, the analyst is
concerned that the mean customer satisfaction score has fallen with the
introduction of the new formula.

Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses to test whether the mean
satisfaction score has decreased.

1)  The parameter of interest is (still) $\mu:\ $the population mean
    customer satisfaction score

2)  The question being asked is: has the mean customer satisfaction
    score decreased from what it was before (which was 6.2)?

The hypotheses will still refer to $\mu$ which is the mean customer
satisfaction score of the population. The analyst wants to test for a
decrease -- and if the mean score has decreased than it would be less
than 6.2. Therefore, the proper form is:

$H_{0}:\ $

$H_{A}:\ $

*Example 9:*

Again, same situation as Example 1. But this time, the analyst would
like to prove that the new formula is better than the old formula. That
is, the analyst would like to test whether the mean customer
satisfaction score has increased.

Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses to test whether the mean
customer satisfaction score has gone up with the new formula's
introduction.

1)  The parameter of interest is (still) $\mu:\ $the population mean
    customer satisfaction score

2)  The question being asked is: Has the mean customer satisfaction
    score increased from what it was before (which was 6.2)?

The hypotheses will still refer to $\mu$ which is the mean customer
satisfaction score of the population. The analyst would like to show
that this parameter has increased -- and if the mean score has increased
than it would be greater than 6.2. Therefore, the hypotheses are:

$H_{0}:\ $

$H_{A}:\ $

*Example 10:*

A manufacturer makes test tubes for laboratory use. These test tubes
must hold exactly 10 milliliters (ml) of liquid. A quality control
analyst would like to check whether or not the production line is
running properly. If the production line goes out of adjustment, then it
may produce test tubes that are on average too large or too small.

Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses to test whether the
production process has gone out of adjustment.

$H_{0}:$

$H_{A}:$

*Example 11:*

A human resources manager is interested in testing the effectiveness of
a new training program. Prior to the training, employees could handle an
average of 11.65 cases per day. The HR manager would like to determine
whether there is evidence that the training has increased the average
number of cases employees can handle per work day.

Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses to test whether the
training increased the average number of cases employees can handle per
day.

$H_{0}:$

$H_{A}:$
    

## Exercises: Hypothesis Tests about a Single Population Mean {-}

*Exercise 1*:

A company has a tech support staff that helps employees handle computer
issues. In the past, the average time to resolve a computer issue was 7
minutes. The company has gathered enough historical data over time on
computer issue resolutions to be confident that the population standard
deviation is 4 minutes.

The company instituted a new ticketing system for computer issues, with
the goal of decreasing the time it takes to resolve them. Once the
ticketing system was in place, a random sample of 35 issues was taken
and the mean time to resolution in the sample was calculated as 5.5
minutes.

Can the company conclude, at an $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level, that
the population mean time to resolution has actually decreased?

*Exercise 2*:

A sports equipment manufacturer produces a line of 20 lb kettlebells.
The manufacturing process can sometimes go out of adjustment. When this
happens, it can make kettlebells that are on average too light or too
heavy. In order to check whether the process is working properly, the
manufacturer takes a random sample of 30 kettlebells, weighs each of
them, and finds that the mean of the sample is 20.26 lbs. From the
specification of its manufacturing equipment, the manufacturer knows
that the population standard deviation in this manufacturing process is
0.78 lbs.

Perform and interpret a hypothesis test to check whether the
manufacturing process is turning out kettlebells that weigh 20 lbs on
average at the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level. Should the process be
adjusted?


## The t Distribution {-}

The t distribution is a probability distribution that is frequently used
as a sampling distribution in hypothesis testing. In some ways, it is
similar to the z distribution, but it has several key differences as
well.

The t distribution:

-   has a total area under the curve of one

-   is approximately bell-shaped, but is not normal

-   has a mean of **zero**

-   is centered on the mean

-   is symmetrical around the mean
    -   "as above, so below the mean"
    -   upper tail t values are positive, lower tail t values are
        negative

-   is a family of distributions, so you must decide which t
    distribution to use
    -   The correct distribution to use in each case will be determined by the **degrees of freedom (df)**, which is calculated from
        information about the sample.

We will use the t distribution to decide whether to reject the null
hypothesis for t test statistics. For the Critical Value approach, we
can look up the CVs on the *t table*. For the p-value approach, we will
use Excel to calculate the p-values for t test statistics (see separate
handout).

#### Using the *t table* {-}

The *t table* is a table of Critical Values of t at particular tail
probabilities.

-   Each row of the t table corresponds to a t distribution with the
    given degrees of freedom (df).

-   Each column of the t table refers to a different upper tail
    probability

-   We can use the t table for lower tail Critical Values too. 
Because the t distribution is symmetrical around the mean of zero, 
a lower tail Critical Value will be the negative of the upper tail 
Critical Value with the same tail probability.
    
#### Examples {-}

***Example 1*** 
Use the t table to look up the following:

a)  The upper tail Critical Value of t at $\alpha = 0.05$ with degrees of freedom $df = 44$

b)  The lower tail Critical Value of t at $\alpha = 0.10$ with degrees of freedom $df = 82$

c)  The two-tailed Critical Values of t at $\alpha = 0.05$ with degrees
    of freedom $df = 37$*


***Example 2*** 
Consider a lower tail test at the $\alpha = 0.10$
significance level with a test statistic of $t_{test} = - 1.157$
and degrees of freedom $df = 38$.

a)  Use the Critical Value approach to decide whether to reject $H_{0}.$

b)  Use the p-value approach to decide whether to reject $H_{0}.$


***Example 3*** Consider a two-tailed test at the $\alpha = 0.01$
significance level with a test statistic of $t_{test} = 3.561$
and degrees of freedom $df = 85.$

a)  Use the Critical Value approach to decide whether to reject $H_{0}.$

b)  Use the p-value approach to decide whether to reject $H_{0}.$


## Exercise: More Hypothesis Testing about a Single Population Mean {-}

*Exercise 1:*

A cosmetics brand hired several Instagram influencers to post about
their makeup in an effort to boost sales. The mean of monthly sales
prior to hiring the influencers was \$11,000 per month per store. In
order to check whether sales are increasing, the company takes a sample
of 50 stores and measures monthly sales. The mean of the sample is
\$11,800, and the standard deviation of the sample is \$4500.

Perform and interpret a hypothesis test to find out if the population
mean sales have increased at an $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level.


## Hypotheses about a Single Population Proportion {-}

Another population parameter we may be interested in is a population
proportion, $p$.

The first concern when dealing with problems about proportions is that
proportions are commonly expressed in words as *percentages*, *shares*,
or *fractions*. Regardless of how they are expressed in words, they
**must** be converted into mathematical proportions before using them in
hypothesis testing. Proportions are always between 0 and 1.

To convert a percentage to a proportion, divide the percentage by 100.
If a proportion is expressed as a fraction, divide out the fraction to
obtain a decimal. A proportion may be expressed as a share, such as 25
out of 72. To convert a share to a proportion, calculate the relative
frequency: $\frac{25}{72} = 0.3472.$

<br>

***Example 1*** *Converting a percentage to a proportion*

97% of the people in Michigan live in the Lower Peninsula. What
proportion of people in Michigan live in the Lower Peninsula?

> *Answer:* 97% is a percentage. To convert it to a proportion, divide
    97 by 100: $p = \frac{97}{100} = \mathbf{0.97}$  
    
<br>

***Example 2*** *Converting a share to a proportion*

A random sample of 38 customers was taken. 23 preferred Brand A. What
proportion of customers preferred Brand A? Round to 4 decimal places,
and recall that a sample proportion is notated $\overline{p}.$

> *Answer:* This proportion is expressed as a share: 23 out of 38
    customers prefer Brand A. To convert it to a proportion, divide the
    number of customers who prefer Brand A by the total number of
    customers: $\overline{p} = \frac{23}{38} = \ \mathbf{0.6053}$  
    
<br>

***Example 3*** *Converting a fraction to a proportion*

1/5 of people prefer oranges to apples. What proportion of people prefer
oranges to apples?

> *Answer:* This proportion is expressed as a fraction. To convert it
  to a proportion, divide it out: $p = \frac{1}{5} = \mathbf{0.2}$

For the following exercises, formulate the hypotheses
$\left( H_{0}\text{\ and\ }H_{A} \right)\ $and be sure to express
$p_{0}$ correctly as a proportion:

<br>

*Exercise 1*:

An optician reads an article that states that industry-wide, 3 in 10
customers rate new glasses as "unsatisfactory". This optician would like
to find out if the proportion of his customers who would say the same is
lower than the industry-wide proportion. Formulate the null and
alternative hypotheses the optician should use.


*Exercise 2*:

A manufacturer suspects that a new plant produces a proportion of
defective parts that is different from the other plants. At the other
plants, the percentage of defective parts is 5.9%. What are the null and
alternative hypotheses the company should use to test whether the
population proportion of defective parts at the new plant differs from
5.9%?

*Exercise 3:*

Suppose that in 2012, 3/5 of people preferred to write in pen rather
than pencil. What null and alternative hypotheses should you use to
determine whether the proportion of people who prefer to write in pen
has increased?


## Exercise: Hypothesis Test about a Single Population Proportion {-}

A company that puts on triathlons finds that over the years, 30% of its
race entrants were women. The company decides to add a women's only
triathlon as one of its races. The company knows this is a risky move.
It could attract more women to sign up for triathlons with the company
because they see it as welcoming to women. Or, female triathletes might
see the offering as patronizing and choose to race with some other
company. Finally, it could be that the same number of women would sign
up with or without a women's only race.

Sometime after introducing the women's only triathlon into its lineup of
races, the company took a random sample of 151 entries and found that 57
of the entries were for women.

Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to find out if the population
proportion of women signing up for triathlons with this company has
changed at the $\alpha = 0.10$ significance level.


## Type I and Type II Error {-}

We use inferences based on probability to make decisions in hypothesis
testing. Basing decisions on probability, and not certainty, introduces
the possibility of error -- that is, of making incorrect inferences and
drawing incorrect conclusions. These are NOT errors in calculation or
process -- these errors are inherent in hypothesis testing, even if you
do everything right.

Two types of error in hypothesis testing:

1)  **Type I Error:** Rejecting the null hypothesis (and
    accepting the alternative hypothesis), when the null hypothesis is
    actually true.

2)  **Type II Error:** Not rejecting the null hypothesis,
    when the null hypothesis is actually false.

These errors have direct, real-world consequences. If you are testing
whether a new program has decreased costs, and a Type I error occurs,
then you would conclude that the program decreased costs when it
actually had not done so. This could lead your company to prolong an
ineffective program. On the other hand, consider the kettlebell
hypothesis test we did on Handout \#4. In that test we did not reject
the null hypotheses, and so we concluded that there was no reason to
shut down the manufacturing line. If a Type II error had occurred in
that situation, then we would have let the line continue when actually
the population mean weight of the bells was not 20lbs, thus leading us
to ship product that did not conform to our 20lb specification.

This is why hypothesis testing should be done while considering other
information and context if at all possible. If a single hypothesis test
yields an unexpected result, then another sample should be taken and the
test should be repeated. It is highly unlikely that two Type I or Type
II errors would occur in successive samples from the same population.

The $\mathbf{\alpha}$ **significance level** in a hypothesis test gives **the
probability of making a Type I error**.

If you do a hypothesis test at the $\alpha = .01$ significance
level, you have a 0.01 probability (in other words, a 1% chance) of
rejecting a null hypothesis that is actually true. To restate that,
1% of the time, a Type I error will happen.

<br>

***Example 1***

A shampoo company has introduced a new formula of a particular shampoo.
In the past, customers have been regularly surveyed about the shampoo,
asked to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 10, and the shampoo has
scored a mean of 6.2.

An analyst at the company would like to test whether the mean
satisfaction score changed after the new formula was introduced.

$$H_{0}: \mu = 6.2 \\
H_{A}: \mu \neq 6.2$$

Suppose the analyst did this hypothesis test and, based on the sample,
rejected $H_0$. However, in reality the population mean customer
satisfaction score is 6.2 (i.e. a value that makes the Null Hypothesis
true), this would be a Type I Error.

If the analyst did a hypothesis test and did not reject $H_0$, but in
reality the actual population mean customer satisfaction score was 5.1
(i.e. a value that means the Null Hypothesis is not true), this would be
a Type II Error.

<br>

***Example 2***

A human resources manager is interested in testing the effectiveness of
a new training program. Prior to the training, employees could handle an
average of 11.65 cases per day. The HR manager would like to determine
whether the training has increased the average number of cases employees
can handle per work day.

$$H_{0}:\\ H_{A}:$$

If the HR manager did a hypothesis test and did not reject $H_0$, but
the actual population mean of cases per day was 12, what type of error
would this be?

What if the actual population mean was 11, and the HR manager rejected
the null hypothesis?

What if the HR manager rejected the null hypothesis based on the sample,
and the true population mean was 12.8?

<br>

***Example 3***

A manufacturer makes test tubes for laboratory use. These test tubes
must hold exactly 10 milliliters (ml) of liquid. If the production line
goes out of adjustment, then it may produce test tubes that are on
average too large or too small. A quality control analyst would like to
check whether the production line is running properly.


$$H_{0}:\\ H_{A}:$$

What if the analyst rejected the null hypothesis based on the sample,
and the true population mean was actually 10 ml?

What if the analyst rejected the null hypothesis based on the sample,
and the true population mean was actually 10.06?

What if the analyst did not reject the null hypothesis, and the true
population mean was actually 10ml?
