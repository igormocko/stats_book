# Introduction {-}
<p class="h-large">Definitions and Notation</p>![](./artwork/00.jpg)

A <mark>population</mark> is the group of all objects (or subjects) of interest. In
a statistical study, the population is defined by the researcher. For
example, a population might be defined as all women between 18 and 34 in
Michigan, if a researcher was interested in studying that group of
subjects. A *sample* is a subset of the population. For example, a
sample from this population could be 100 randomly selected women between
18 and 34 in Michigan. While it is populations that we are ultimately
interested in knowing about, we usually do not observe them directly.
Instead, samples are what we actually observe and measure in statistical
studies. *Statistical inference* is the process of drawing conclusions
about a population, based on a sample taken from that population.

Why is randomization important? Only *random* samples can provide the
basis for statistical inference, because only random samples are
representative of the population as a whole.

It should be clear from the foregoing discussion that we will be dealing
with characteristics of populations and characteristics of samples from
those populations in this class. Therefore, it will be important to
differentiate carefully between them. We do that by using different
terms (when possible) and different notation (always) when referring to
populations and samples.

A *parameter* is a characteristic of a population. A *sample statistic*
is a characteristic of a sample. For example, the mean of a population
is a parameter, while the mean of a sample is a sample statistic. Both
are averages, but they are measured on two different groups, and so they
are two different things. Characteristics measured on samples *estimate*
the corresponding characteristics of the populations those samples came
from. *Sample statistics*, in other words, are *estimates* of their
corresponding *population parameters*.

The values of sample statistics almost always differ slightly from the
values of the corresponding parameters in the underlying population due
to *random variation*, also called *random error*. So, even a
representative, random sample is likely to differ slightly from the
underlying population. Suppose you had a population with a mean of 10.
Further suppose that you took 5 different random samples from it. In the
first sample, just randomly, a few more low values might be chosen. So
the mean of the sample would come out a little lower than the population
mean, like 9.4. But then in the second sample, a few higher values might
be chosen instead. So then the second sample would come out with a mean
on the high side, like 10.2. And so it would go with the other three
samples -- each one chosen randomly, each slightly different from the
other samples, and from the underlying population they all came from. In
the process of statistical inference, it will be our task to distinguish
between this type of random variation, due to random chance, and true
variation that can give us information about the value of a population
parameter. We will do this by using a technique called hypothesis
testing.

Notation is a part of life when learning statistics, and you should
approach it like learning a language. The symbols are shorthand ways to
refer to important concepts. You will need to become familiar with the
following notation:

## The z Distribution {-}

The $z$ *distribution*, also called the *standard normal distribution*,
is a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of
one. It is used to standardize values in order to determine their
probability. Probability in a $z$ distribution is represented as the
area between the curve and the horizontal axis -- often called the area
under the curve. (This is actually true of all probability distributions
-- they all use area under the curve to measure probability).

Let's draw a $z$ distribution and label some of its important features:

$z$ values are in units of standard deviations, so they express how many
standard deviations away from the mean a particular value is. For
example, a value that standardizes to a $z$ of $2.0$ is two standard
deviations above the mean, while a value that standardizes to a $z$ of
$- 1.6$ is $1.6$ standard deviations below the mean.

The $z$ *table* is used to look up probabilities for different values of
$z$. The probability of a value falling at or above a given $z$ is
called the upper tail probability, or *upper tail p-value.* The
probability of a value falling at or below a given $z$ is called the
lower tail probability, or *lower tail p-value*. The probability of a
value falling a given distance away from the mean in either tail is
called the *two-tailed p-value* (don't worry -- there will be more on
this one later). These p-values will be very important in hypothesis
testing, where they will be the evidence in the *p-value approach to
rejecting the null hypothesis.*

*Example 1*. What is the probability that a randomly drawn z value would
be greater than or equal to 1.24? This is what is called the **upper
tail p-value** of $z = 1.24$

*Example 2.* What is the probability that a randomly drawn z value would
be less than or equal to $- 1.84$? This is what is called the **lower
tail p-value** of $z = - 1.84.$

*Example 3.* What is the probability that a randomly drawn z value would
be at least $2.15$ standard deviations away from the mean? This is what
is called a **two-tailed p-value**.

Now it is your turn! Try the three exercises below.

*Exercise 1.* What is the UT p-value of $z = 2.50$?

*Exercise 2.* What is the LT p-value of $z = - 1.00$?

*Exercise 3.* What is the 2T p-value of $z = - 2.82$?

**[Critical Values of Z]{.underline}**

Critical Values (CVs) are values of $z$ with given tail probabilities.
In notation, Critical Values are always subscripted with a probability.
In general, $\mathbf{z}_{\mathbf{\alpha}}$ is the CV of $z$ with
$\alpha$ probability in the upper tail, and
$\mathbf{-}\mathbf{z}_{\mathbf{\alpha}}\ $is the CV of $z$ with $\alpha$
probability in the lower tail.

Some common CVs of $z$ are given in the inset table on the first page of
the z table, reproduced here:

![](media/image1.png){width="2.1302241907261594in"
height="1.6198031496062992in"}

where $\alpha = \ $the tail probability

and $z_{\alpha} = \ $the Critical Value of $\text{z\ }$with $\alpha$
probability in the tail

*Example 4.* Look up the **upper tail CV** of $\text{z\ }$at
$\alpha = 0.05.$ Draw and fully label the $z$ distribution showing the
CV and shading in the tail probability.

*Example 5.* Look up the **lower tail CV** of $z$ at $\alpha = 0.01.$
Draw and fully label the $z$ distribution showing the CV and shading in
the tail probability.

*Example 6.* Look up the **two-tailed Critical Values** of $z$ at
$\alpha = 0.05.\ $Draw and fully label the $z$ distribution. Here are
the steps to look up the 2T CVs:

1.  Split $\alpha$ between the two tails by dividing $\alpha$ by 2

2.  Look up the LT CV of $\text{z\ }$at $\alpha/2$ and the UT CV of
    $\text{z\ }$at $\alpha/2$. These are your 2T CVs.

**[Why do we need Critical Values?]{.underline}**

Critical Values can give us information about the p-value (the
probability) of other values of $z$. This use of CVs will be very
important in hypothesis testing, where they will be the evidence in the
*Critical Value approach to rejecting the null hypothesis.*

What is the UT CV of $z$ at $\alpha = 0.10?$ Draw and fully label the
$z$ distribution. What can this picture tell us about the UT p-value of
$z = 4.1?$
