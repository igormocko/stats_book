## Notation & Definitions {-}

In Chapter 10, we learn how to make inferences about two populations --
either about the difference between two population means, or the
difference between two population proportions. We draw those inferences
by taking a sample from each population, and then using the sample data
to do hypothesis testing or to calculate confidence intervals. In each
problem, we will treat one population as Population 1, and the other as
Population 2, and those numbers become subscripts in our notation (see
below). Sample 1 is the sample taken from Population 1, and Sample 2 is
the sample taken from Population 2.

## Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Population Means {-}


### 1. Formulating the Hypotheses {-}
There are three possible forms of hypotheses. They each correspond to a different
question you might want to ask about the difference between two population means, $\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}.$  
**Note:** in each of the hypotheses, $D_0$ is a number. It is the hypothesized difference between
the two population means.  

$D_0$ should be set to 0, unless you are testing for a **specific numerical difference** 
between the means (like a difference of 5 or 12 or 178). 
If $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$, then there is no difference
between the means - they are equal.

<br>

| $H_0:\mu_1 - \mu_2 \geq D_0$ <br> $H_A: \mu_1 - \mu_2 < D_0$ | $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \leq D_0$ <br> $H_A: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > D_0$ | $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0$ <br> $H_A: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq D_0$ |

<br>

:::example

**Example 1**  

Suppose you have two populations and you want to know   
whether the mean of population 1 is lower than the mean of           
population 2. This corresponds to a lower tail test. No specific     
numerical difference between the two populations is asked for, so we 
set $D_0$ to 0 and the hypotheses would be:                        

$$H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2\geq 0 \\ H_A: \mu_1 - \mu_2 < 0$$

<br>

**Example 2**  

Suppose you have two populations, and you want to know  
whether the difference between their means is 25 or not. (Of course, 
a hypothesis test can only prove that the difference is NOT 25, not  
that it IS 25). This question matches with a two-tailed test. It     
asks for a specific numerical difference between the means of 25, so 
we set $D_0$ to 25 and the hypotheses are:      

$$H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 25 \\ H_A: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 25 $$
:::

**NOTE:** The procedure explained above is based on drawing two
random, independent samples - one from each population - and taking
the difference between the means of those samples, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$.


### 2. Choosing and Calculating the Test Statistics {-}
The sample statistic of interest in hypothesis tests about the
difference between two population means is the difference between the
two sample means, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$. We will
need to determine how probable a given difference between two sample
means is in order to decide whether or not to reject $H_0$. To do
that, we will calculate a test statistic using information from both
samples, and sometimes from both populations.

For hypothesis testing about the difference between two population
means, the correct choice of test statistic depends on the sampling
distribution of $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, which in
turn depends on what information you have about the variability in the
underlying populations. The **population standard deviations**,
$\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$, are sometimes known from prior
knowledge, historical information, or past experience. On the other
hand, if $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are unknown, then we use
the information about variability of the samples: the standard
deviations measured on the samples themselves,
$s_1$ and $s_2$.

**When $\mathbf{\sigma_1}$ and $\mathbf{\sigma_2}$ are KNOWN**

Under the assumption that $H_0$ is true as an equality, the sampling
distribution of the difference between the two sample means,
$\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, follows the $z$
distribution. Therefore, we standardize the samples against the $z$
distribution by calculating the following $z$ test statistic:

<br>

$$z_{test} = \frac{{(\bar{x}}_1 - {\bar{x}}_2) - D_0}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \ \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

where  
<center>
$\bar{x}_1$ = the mean of sample 1   
$\bar{x}_2$ = the mean of sample 2  
$D_0$ = the hypothesized difference between the means (from $H_0$, $H_A$)  
$\sigma_1$ = the standard deviation of population 1  
$\sigma_2$ = the standard deviation of population 2  
$n_1$ = the sample size of sample 1  
$n_2$ = the sample size of sample 2  
</center>
<br>

**When $\mathbf{\sigma_1}$ and $\mathbf{\sigma_2}$ are UNKNOWN**

Under the assumption that $H_0$ is true as an equality, the sampling
distribution of the difference between the two sample means,
$\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, follows the $t$
distribution with $degrees\ of\ freedom$ given by the equation
below. Therefore, we standardize the samples against the $t$
distribution by calculating the following $t$ test statistic:  
<br>
$$t_{test} = \frac{{(\bar{x}}_1 - {\bar{x}}_2) - D_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \ \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$


where  
<center>
$\bar{x}_1$ = the mean of sample 1  
$\bar{x}_2$ = the mean of sample 2  
$D_0$ = the hypothesized difference between the means (from $H_0$, $H_A$)  
$s_1$ = the standard deviation of sample 1    
$s_2$ = the standard deviation of sample 2  
$n_1$ = the sample size of sample 1  
$n_2$ = the sample size of sample 2  
and the degrees of freedom are:  
<br>
$df = \frac{\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_{2}^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{\frac{1}{n_1 - 1}\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{n_2 - 1}\left( \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}$
</center>
<br>
**NOTE:** if the degrees of freedom has decimal places, **ALWAYS round DOWN to the nearest whole number.**


### 3.  Deciding whether or not to reject $\mathbf{H_0}$ {-}

There are two approaches to deciding whether or not to reject the
Null:

-   In the **p-value approach**, we **compare** the **p-value** of our
    test statistic to the $\alpha$ **significance level** and
    reject $H_0$ if the p-value is less than or equal to the $\alpha$
    significance level.

-   In the **critical value approach**, we **compare** the **test statistic** 
    to **a critical value** -- this can be done with a
    diagram in which we use the critical value(s) to construct a
    rejection region or regions; if the test statistic is in a rejection
    region, we reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. Or, this step can be
    accomplished by following the mathematical rules given in the tables
    below.

<br>

<center> **When to Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$ for z-test statistics**

|  | **For a Lower Tail Test** | **For an Upper Tail Test** | **For a Two-Tail Test** |

| **CV approach** | If $z_{test} \leq -z_{\alpha}$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If $z_{test} > -z_{\alpha}$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. | If $z_{test} \geq z_{\alpha}$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If $z_{test} < z_{\alpha}$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. | If $z_{test} \leq -z_{\alpha/2}$ OR $z_{test} \geq z_{\alpha/2}$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. <br><br> If $-z_{\alpha/2} < z_{test} < z_{\alpha/2}$, do not reject $H_0$; $H_A$ is unsupported. |

**NOTES:**  
  1. $z_{test}$ is the Test Statistic  
  2. $z_{\alpha}, -z_{\alpha}, and\ z_{\alpha/2}$ are, respectively, UT, LT, and 2T Critical Values

**NOTES:**  
  1. $t_{test}$ is the Test Statistic  
  2. $t_{\alpha}, -t_{\alpha}, and\ t_{\alpha/2}$ are Critical Values  
  3. The correct t distribution to use when determining the p-value or the Critical Value depends on the degrees of freedom.



### 4. Interpreting the Test {-}

(Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis
tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the
parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the
answer to that question. In other words, we must *interpret* the
conclusion of our test in terms of the original question.

Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null
hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you
reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given
$\alpha$ level of significance you may conclude that $H_A$ is true.
If you do not reject $H_0$, then you must conclude that $H_A$ is
unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how
to *interpret* hypothesis tests: *always look at the alternative
hypothesis!*

In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers
from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each
interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and
says either that it is true or that it is unsupported by the evidence.

  1. $\mu_1$ is the true value of the mean of population 1  
     $\mu_2$ is the true value of the mean of population 2   
  2. $D_0$ is the hypothesized difference between the two population means, $\mu_1 - \mu_2$
    

### Assumptions Underlying Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Two Population Means {-}

All hypothesis tests use sampling distributions to determine the
probability of sample statistics -- that is how we determine whether or
not to reject the null hypothesis. In order for us to be confident that
our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way
the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If
the assumptions are not met -- that is, if any given assumption is not
true -- then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They
may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the
wrong conclusions.

-   **For the hypothesis tests presented above about the difference between two population means, $\mathbf{\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}}$:**
    -   Both samples must be random and independent of one another

    -   If both populations are normally distributed, then the sample
        sizes can be small

    -   If both populations are not normally distributed, or if one or
        more of the distributions are unknown, then the sample sizes
        must both be greater than or equal to 30
        $(n_1 \geq 30\ and\ n_{2} \geq 30)$

- **When $\mathbf{\sigma_1}$ and $\mathbf{\sigma_2}$ are unknown (that is, when you are using the t distribution):**
    1.  It is recommended to have equal sample sizes, although this
        is not strictly necessary. If the sample sizes are nearly
        equal, then having sample sizes that satisfy
        $n_1 + n_2 \geq 20$ are adequate.

    2.  if the populations have skewed distributions or have 
        outliers,  the sample sizes must be larger


## Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Two Population Proportions {-}

### 1. Formulating the Hypotheses {-}
There are three possible forms of hypotheses. They each correspond to a different
question you might want to ask about the true value of the
difference between two population proportions, $p_1 - p_2$.
<br>

<center> **Hypotheses for Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Two Population Proportions,** $\mathbf{p_1}-\mathbf{p_2}$ 
</center>

| **Lower Tail Test** | **Upper Tail Test** | **Two-Tailed Test** |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| $H_0:p_1 - p_2 \geq 0$ <br> $H_A: p_1 - p_2 < 0$ | $H_0: p_1 - p_2 \leq 0$ <br> $H_A: p_1 - p_2 > 0$ | $H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0$ <br> $H_A: p_1 - p_2 \neq 0$ |
|| Answers questions about ||
| If the true proportion of population 1, $p_1$, is less than the true proportion of population 2, $p_2$. | If the true proportion of population 1, $p_1$, is greater than the true proportion of population 2, $p_2$. | If the true proportion of population 1, $p_1$, is different from the true proportion of population 2, $p_2$. |

<br>


**NOTE:** The procedure explained in this handout is based on drawing two
random, independent samples - one from each population - and taking
the difference between the proportions of those samples,
$\bar{p}_1 - \bar{p}_2$.


### 2. Choosing and Calculating the Test Statistics {-}
**NOTE:** The logic is the same as all previous hypothesis tests: we are
looking to see whether our sample values contradict the null
hypothesis.

The sample statistic of interest in hypothesis tests about the
difference between two population proportions is the difference
between the two sample proportions,
${\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2.$ In order to decide whether
or not to reject $H_{0},$ we need to use a sampling distribution of
${\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2$ to determine the probability
of a given difference between two sample proportions, under the
assumption that $H_0$ is true as an equality -- that is, assuming
that the two proportions are equal. If the sample statistic
${\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2$ is less probable than the
$\alpha$ significance level, then it contradicts the null hypothesis
($H_0$) and we will reject $H_0$.

Under the assumption that $H_0$ is true as an equality, the sampling
distribution of ${\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2$ follows the
$z$ distribution. Therefore, we have to standardize the sample
information against the $z$ distribution by calculating the $z$ test
statistic as follows:

**Calculating the $\mathbf{z}$ Test Statistic for Hypothesis Tests about $\mathbf{p_1 - p_2}$**

  1.  First, calculate the **pooled estimator,** $\mathbf{\bar{p}}$**:**

$$\bar{p} = \frac{n_1{\bar{p}}_{1} + n_2{\bar{p}}_{2}}{n_1 + n_2}$$

  2.  Second, calculate the $z$ test statistic:

$$z_{test} = \frac{{\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2}{\sqrt{\bar{p}\left( 1 - \bar{p} \right)\left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right)}}$$

where  
<center>
$\bar{p}_1$ = the proportion of sample 1   
$\bar{p}_2$ = the proportion of sample 2
$\bar{p}$ = the pooled estimator (calculated in Step 1)  
$n_1$ = the sample size of sample 1  
$n_2$ = the sample size of sample 2  
</center>
<br>


### 3.  Deciding whether or not to reject $\mathbf{H_0}$ {-}

The rules for z test statistics remain the same regardless of the
context in which the z test statistic is used. See the rejection rules
for z test statistics given above.

### 4. Interpreting the Test {-}

(Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis
tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the
parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the
answer to that question. In other words, we must *interpret* the
conclusion of our test in terms of the original question.

Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null
hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you
reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given
$\alpha$ level of significance you may conclude that $H_A$ is true.
If you do not reject $H_0$, then you must conclude that $H_A$ is
unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how
to *interpret* hypothesis tests: *always look at the alternative hypothesis!*

In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers
from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each
interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and
says either that it is true or that it is unsupported by the evidence.

**NOTES:**    
$p_1$  is the true value of the proportion of population 1  
$p_2$ is the true value of the proportion of population 2

<br>

### Assumptions Underlying Hypothesis Tests About $\mathbf{p_1-p_2}$ {-}

In order to use this hypothesis test:

-   The samples must be random and independent

-   The following conditions must hold true:

$$n_1\bar{p}_1 \geq 5 \\
n_1(1 - \bar{p}_1) \geq 5 \\ 
n_2\bar{p}_2 \geq 5 \\
n_2(1 - \bar{p}_2) \geq 5$$


where  
<center>
$n_1$ = the sample size of sample 1  
$\bar{p}_1$ = the proportion of sample 1  
$n_2$ = the sample size of sample 2  
$\bar{p}_2$ = the proportion of sample 2
</center>

### Formulating Hypotheses: What is the difference? {-}

::: example
**Example 1**  

An article suggests that Business School students take more credit hours
on average per semester than students in the liberal arts and sciences.
An analyst wishes to see whether this is true at Wayne State. How should
the null and alternative hypotheses be formulated? Use Business School
students as Population 1.

**Example 2**  

Is there any difference between Mac users and PC users when it comes to
mean customer satisfaction? Formulate the null and alternative
hypotheses that could be used to test this question. Use Mac users as
Population 1.

**Example 3**  

Sprint advertises that its prices for cell phone service are lower than
Verizon. Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses to test Sprint's
claim. Use Sprint customers as Population 1.

**Example 4**  

An analyst suspects that, on average, iPhone users download 2 apps per
month more than Android users. If the analyst wants to test for this
difference, what should the null and alternative hypotheses be? (HINT:
the test must determine whether the difference between the mean apps
downloaded by iPhone users and Android users is 2 or not). Use iPhone
users as Population 1.

### Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Two Population Means: Exercises {-}

**Exercise 1**  

*Using data from Chapter 10, Exercise 7 (although changing the question
asked)*

*Consumer Reports* uses a survey of readers to obtain customer
satisfaction ratings for the nation's largest retailers (*Consumer
Reports*, March 2012). Each survey respondent is asked to rate a
specified retailer in terms of six factors: quality of products,
selection, value, checkout efficiency, service, and store layout. An
overall satisfaction score summarizes the rating for each respondent
with 100 meaning the respondent is completely satisfied in terms of all
six factors. From past experience, *Consumer Reports* customer
satisfaction scores have had a population standard deviation, regardless
of store, of 12. We assume that customer satisfaction scores are
normally distributed.

Two independent, random samples were taken. A random sample of 25 Target
customers had a mean customer satisfaction score of 79. A random sample
of 30 Walmart customers had a mean customer satisfaction score of 71.

Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine whether the
population mean customer satisfaction score for Target is higher than
the population mean customer satisfaction score for Walmart at the
$\alpha = .01$ significance level. Use Target customers as Population 1.

**Exercise 2**  

A winery was interested in the difference between white wine and red
wine drinkers when it comes to average weekly wine consumption. Two
random, independent samples were taken. A random sample of 35 white wine
drinkers drank a mean of 17.6 ounces of wine per week with a standard
deviation of 4.2. A random sample of 38 red wine drinkers drank a mean
of 14.7 ounces of wine per week with a standard deviation of 3.64.

Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weekly
wine consumption of white wine drinkers differs from the mean weekly
wine consumption of red wine drinkers at the $\alpha = .05$ significance
level. Consider the white wine drinkers to be Population 1.

### Hypothesis Testing for the Difference between Two Population Proportions: Exercise {-}

A heart rate monitor manufacturer offers a service for users to upload
their workout data and analyze it using a web-based app. The
manufacturer is interested in different groups of athletes and how they
compare in using this upload service. The question is: do triathletes
and pure runners differ in terms of the proportion that uses the upload
service?

Random, independent samples of triathletes and pure runners were taken.
In a sample of 292 triathletes, 79.45% used the upload service. In a
sample of 315 pure runners, 72.38% used the upload service.

Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine whether triathletes
and pure runners differ in the proportion that uses the upload service
for their workout data. Use an $\alpha = .01$ significance level. Assign
triathletes as Population 1 and pure runners as Population 2.

## Confidence Intervals{-}

**Hypothesis tests** are one way to draw inferences about population
parameters from sample statistics. Hypothesis tests can answer questions
about whether parameters are equal to or not equal to one other, greater
than one another, or less than one another.

**Confidence interval estimates** are another way to draw inferences about
population parameters from sample statistics. Confidence intervals give
us information about what the difference between two population
parameters actually is, to a specified degree of certainty. In the case
of difference in means, the **confidence interval estimate** gives 
**a range that contains the true difference between two population means.**

Confidence intervals are always calculated at a given level of
confidence, which is a percentage that is related to the $\alpha$
significance level. *The percent confidence is* $100(1-\alpha)$.

This table shows the conversions between some typical $\alpha$
significance levels and the corresponding confidence levels:

| **$\mathbf{\alpha}$ significance level** | **Confidence level (%)** |
|:---:|:--:|
| 0.10 | 90% |
| 0.05 | 95% |
| 0.01 | 99% |

 
You can calculate these conversions yourself. For example, if
$\alpha = \ 0.01,$ the confidence level is:

$$100(1 - \alpha) = 100(1 - 0.01) = 100(0.99) = .99\%$$  

  
A **confidence interval** consists of two parts: a ***point estimate***
plus or minus a **margin of error**. A point estimate is a single
number that estimates a population parameter. The margin of error
determines the range around the point estimate. In the equations that
follow, the point estimate is the part before the $\pm$ and the margin
of error is the part following it.

The point estimate minus the margin of error is the **lower bound (LB)** 
of the confidence interval, and the point estimate plus the
margin of error is the **upper bound (UB)**. Confidence intervals are
usually reported in square brackets, with the bounds separated by a
comma, as in **[LB, UB].**

## Confidence Intervals for the Difference between Two Population Means {-}

For the difference between two population means, choosing the correct
formula for the confidence interval estimate depends on whether
$\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ - the population standard deviations for
population 1 and 2 - are KNOWN or UNKNOWN.


**If $\mathbf{\sigma_1, \sigma_2}$ are KNOWN,** the $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ 
**confidence interval for the difference between two population means,**
$\mu_{1} - \mu_{2},$ is given by:

$$\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\  \pm  z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}$$
where  
<center>
$\bar{x}_1$ = the mean of sample 1   
$\bar{x}_2$ = the mean of sample 2  
$z_{\alpha/2}$ = the positive critical value of $z$ at  $\frac{\alpha}{2}$  
$\sigma_1$ = the standard deviation of population 1  
$\sigma_2$ = the standard deviation of population 2  
$n_1$ = the sample size of sample 1    
$n_2$ = the sample size of sample 2  
</center>
<br>

<br>

**If $\mathbf{\sigma_1, \sigma_2}$ are UNKNOWN,** the sample standard deviations 
$s_1$ and $s_2$ must be used instead, and the $100(1 - \alpha)\%$
**confidence interval for the difference between two population means,**
$\mu_{1} - \mu_{2},$ is given by:

$$\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\  \pm \ t_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$

where $t_{\alpha/2}$ has the degrees of freedom:

$$df = \frac{\left( \frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}} \right)^{2}}{\frac{1}{n_{1} - 1}\left( \frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} \right)^{2} + \frac{1}{n_{2} - 1}\left( \frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}} \right)^{2}}$$
<center>
(**NOTE:** Always round the degrees of freedom DOWN to the nearest whole number, 
no matter what)  

and  
$\bar{x}_1$ = the mean of sample 1   
$\bar{x}_2$ = the mean of sample 2  
$t_{\alpha/2}$ = the positive critical value of $t$ at  $\frac{\alpha}{2}$  
$s_1$ = the standard deviation of sample 1  
$s_2$ = the standard deviation of sample 2  
$n_1$ = the sample size of sample 1    
$n_2$ = the sample size of sample 2  
</center>
<br>

The template for the **interpretation** of a confidence interval for
$\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}$ is:

**With ___ % confidence, we can conclude that the true difference between** 
$\mathbf{\mu_1}$ **and** $\mathbf{\mu_2}$ **is between [Lower Bound] and [Upper Bound].**

**IMPORTANT:** If the interval **contains zero**, then there is 
**no statistically significant difference** between the two means.

As usual, you should fill in the meaning for the notation above,
referring to the specific interval you are interpreting.

## Confidence Intervals for the Difference Between Two Proportions {-}

A confidence interval estimate for the difference between two population
proportions, $p_1 - p_2$, is a range of numbers that contains the
true difference between the two population proportions, to a given level
of confidence.

**BE CAREFUL:** confidence interval calculations for the difference between
two population proportions DO NOT use the pooled estimator,
$\bar{p}$, that is used in hypothesis testing for difference in
proportions.

The $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ *confidence interval estimate for the difference
between two population proportions,* $p_1 - p_2$, is given by:

$$\bar{p}_1 - \bar{p}_2\  \pm \ z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\bar{p}_1(1 - \bar{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\bar{p}_2\left(1 - \bar{p}_2 \right)}{n_2}}\ $$
where  
<center>
$\bar{p}_1$ = the proportion of sample 1   
$\bar{p}_2$ = the proportion of sample 2  
$z_{\alpha/2}$ = the positive critical value of $z$ at  $\frac{\alpha}{2}$  
$n_1$ = the sample size of sample 1    
$n_2$ = the sample size of sample 2  
</center>
<br>

Remember, the point estimate minus the margin of error is the ***lower
bound*** **(LB)** of the confidence interval, and the point estimate
plus the margin of error is the **upper bound (UB)**. Confidence
intervals are usually reported in square brackets, with the bounds
separated by a comma, as in **[LB, UB].**

The template for the **interpretation** of a confidence interval for
$p_1 - p_2$ is:

**With ___ % confidence, we can conclude that the true difference between** 
$\mathbf{p_1}$ **and** $\mathbf{p_2}$ **is between [Lower Bound] and [Upper Bound].**


**IMPORTANT:** If the interval **contains zero**, then there is 
**no statistically significant difference** between the two proportions.


### Confidence Intervals for Differences: Exercises {-}

**Exercise 1**

Do Android or iPhone users differ in how many apps they download per
month? What is the difference between them? An analyst takes two
independent, random samples: one of Android users and one of iPhone
users. The sample of 50 Android users downloaded a mean of 2.4 apps per
month. The sample of 55 iPhone users downloaded a mean of 3.7 apps per
month. Historical data suggest that the population standard deviation
for Android users is 1 app per month, and the population standard
deviation for iPhone users is 1.2 apps per month.

Calculate and interpret the 95% confidence interval estimate for the
difference in mean apps downloaded per month between Android and iPhone
users. Assign population 1 to be iPhone users.

**Exercise 2**

An HR manager would like to know how much the mean number of overtime
hours differs between employees that have children at home and those who
don't have children at home. The manager takes a random sample of 35
employees with children at home and finds that these employees work a
mean of 4.2 overtime hours and have a standard deviation of 4 hours. An
independent random sample of 40 employees without children at home has a
mean of 6.5 overtime hours and a standard deviation of 5.9 hours.

Calculate and interpret a 99% confidence interval estimate for the
difference in mean overtime hours between these two groups. Use
employees with children at home as Population 1. The t-distribution
appropriate for use in this instance has 68 degrees of freedom. (On your
own time, calculate out the degrees of freedom -- remember to *always
round down* when calculating degrees of freedom this way!!)

**Exercise 3**

A heart rate monitor manufacturer offers a service for users to upload
their workout data and analyze it using a web-based app. The
manufacturer is interested in different groups of athletes and how they
compare in using this upload service. The company would like to know:
what is the difference between the proportions of triathletes and
cyclists who upload their workout data? Random, independent samples of
triathletes and cyclists were taken. In a sample of 301 triathletes, 239
used the upload service. In a sample of 278 cyclists, 191 used the
upload service.

Construct and interpret a 90% confidence interval estimate for the
difference between the proportions of triathletes and cyclists that use
the upload service. Use Triathletes as Population 1. Can you confirm
that there is indeed a difference between the proportions, at the 90%
confidence level? If so, which group has a higher proportion who uploads
their data?
