<h2>Notation &amp; Definitions</h2>
<p>In Chapter 10, we learn how to make inferences about two populations –
either about the difference between two population means, or the
difference between two population proportions. We draw those inferences
by taking a sample from each population, and then using the sample data
to do hypothesis testing or to calculate confidence intervals. In each
problem, we will treat one population as Population 1, and the other as
Population 2, and those numbers become subscripts in our notation (see
below). Sample 1 is the sample taken from Population 1, and Sample 2 is
the sample taken from Population 2.</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> in each of the hypotheses, <span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> is a number. It is the hypothesized difference between
the two population means.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> should be set to 0, unless you are testing for a <strong>specific numerical difference</strong>
between the means (like a difference of 5 or 12 or 178).
If <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\)</span>, then there is no difference
between the means - they are equal.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have two populations and you want to know<br />
whether the mean of population 1 is lower than the mean of<br />
population 2. This corresponds to a lower tail test. No specific<br />
numerical difference between the two populations is asked for, so we
set <span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> to 0 and the hypotheses would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2\geq 0 \\ H_A: \mu_1 - \mu_2 &lt; 0\]</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have two populations, and you want to know<br />
whether the difference between their means is 25 or not. (Of course,
a hypothesis test can only prove that the difference is NOT 25, not<br />
that it IS 25). This question matches with a two-tailed test. It<br />
asks for a specific numerical difference between the means of 25, so
we set <span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> to 25 and the hypotheses are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 25 \\ H_A: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 25 \]</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The procedure explained above is based on drawing two
random, independent samples - one from each population - and taking
the difference between the means of those samples, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="choosing-and-calculating-the-test-statistics" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
<h3>2. Choosing and Calculating the Test Statistics</h3>
<p>The sample statistic of interest in hypothesis tests about the
difference between two population means is the difference between the
two sample means, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\)</span>. We will
need to determine how probable a given difference between two sample
means is in order to decide whether or not to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. To do
that, we will calculate a test statistic using information from both
samples, and sometimes from both populations.</p>
<p>For hypothesis testing about the difference between two population
means, the correct choice of test statistic depends on the sampling
distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\)</span>, which in
turn depends on what information you have about the variability in the
underlying populations. The <strong>population standard deviations</strong>,
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_2\)</span>, are sometimes known from prior
knowledge, historical information, or past experience. On the other
hand, if <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_2\)</span> are unknown, then we use
the information about variability of the samples: the standard
deviations measured on the samples themselves,
<span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>When <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\sigma_1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\sigma_2}\)</span> are KNOWN</strong></p>
<p>Under the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true as an equality, the sampling
distribution of the difference between the two sample means,
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\)</span>, follows the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>
distribution. Therefore, we standardize the samples against the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>

<h3>3. Deciding whether or not to reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{H_0}\)</span></h3>
<p>There are two approaches to deciding whether or not to reject the
Null:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the <strong>p-value approach</strong>, we <strong>compare</strong> the <strong>p-value</strong> of our
test statistic to the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> <strong>significance level</strong> and
reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> if the p-value is less than or equal to the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
significance level.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>critical value approach</strong>, we <strong>compare</strong> the <strong>test statistic</strong>
to <strong>a critical value</strong> – this can be done with a
diagram in which we use the critical value(s) to construct a
rejection region or regions; if the test statistic is in a rejection
region, we reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and accept <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>. Or, this step can be
accomplished by following the mathematical rules given in the tables

<h3>4. Interpreting the Test</h3>
<p>(Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis
tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the
parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the
answer to that question. In other words, we must <em>interpret</em> the
conclusion of our test in terms of the original question.</p>
<p>Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null
hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you
reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level of significance you may conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> is true.
If you do not reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, then you must conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> is
unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how
to <em>interpret</em> hypothesis tests: <em>always look at the alternative
hypothesis!</em></p>
<p>In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers
from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each
interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and
says either that it is true or that it is unsupported by the evidence.</p>

<h3>Assumptions Underlying Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Two Population Means</h3>
<p>All hypothesis tests use sampling distributions to determine the
probability of sample statistics – that is how we determine whether or
not to reject the null hypothesis. In order for us to be confident that
our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way
the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If
the assumptions are not met – that is, if any given assumption is not
true – then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They
may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the
wrong conclusions.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The procedure explained in this handout is based on drawing two

</div>
<div id="choosing-and-calculating-the-test-statistics-1" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
<h3>2. Choosing and Calculating the Test Statistics</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The logic is the same as all previous hypothesis tests: we are
looking to see whether our sample values contradict the null
hypothesis.</p>
<p>The sample statistic of interest in hypothesis tests about the
difference between two population proportions is the difference
between the two sample proportions,
<span class="math inline">\({\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2.\)</span> In order to decide whether
or not to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_{0},\)</span> we need to use a sampling distribution of
<span class="math inline">\({\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2\)</span> to determine the probability
of a given difference between two sample proportions, under the
assumption that <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true as an equality – that is, assuming
that the two proportions are equal. If the sample statistic
<span class="math inline">\({\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2\)</span> is less probable than the
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> significance level, then it contradicts the null hypothesis
(<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) and we will reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Under the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is true as an equality, the sampling
distribution of <span class="math inline">\({\bar{p}}_1 - {\bar{p}}_2\)</span> follows the
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> distribution. Therefore, we have to standardize the sample
information against the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> distribution by calculating the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> test
statistic as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Calculating the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{z}\)</span> Test Statistic for Hypothesis Tests about <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p_1 - p_2}\)</span></strong></p>

<h3>4. Interpreting the Test</h3>
<p>(Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis
tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the
parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the
answer to that question. In other words, we must <em>interpret</em> the
conclusion of our test in terms of the original question.</p>
<p>Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null
hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you
reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level of significance you may conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> is true.
If you do not reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, then you must conclude that <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> is
unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how
to <em>interpret</em> hypothesis tests: <em>always look at the alternative hypothesis!</em></p>
<p>In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers
from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each
interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and
says either that it is true or that it is unsupported by the evidence.</p>

<h3>Formulating Hypotheses: What is the difference?</h3>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>An article suggests that Business School students take more credit hours
on average per semester than students in the liberal arts and sciences.
An analyst wishes to see whether this is true at Wayne State. How should
the null and alternative hypotheses be formulated? Use Business School
students as Population 1.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Is there any difference between Mac users and PC users when it comes to
mean customer satisfaction? Formulate the null and alternative
hypotheses that could be used to test this question. Use Mac users as
Population 1.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Sprint advertises that its prices for cell phone service are lower than
Verizon. Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses to test Sprint’s
claim. Use Sprint customers as Population 1.</p>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>
<p>An analyst suspects that, on average, iPhone users download 2 apps per
month more than Android users. If the analyst wants to test for this
difference, what should the null and alternative hypotheses be? (HINT:
the test must determine whether the difference between the mean apps
downloaded by iPhone users and Android users is 2 or not). Use iPhone
users as Population 1.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Two Population Means: Exercises</h3>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p>
<p><em>Using data from Chapter 10, Exercise 7 (although changing the question
asked)</em></p>
<p><em>Consumer Reports</em> uses a survey of readers to obtain customer
satisfaction ratings for the nation’s largest retailers (<em>Consumer
Reports</em>, March 2012). Each survey respondent is asked to rate a
specified retailer in terms of six factors: quality of products,
selection, value, checkout efficiency, service, and store layout. An
overall satisfaction score summarizes the rating for each respondent
with 100 meaning the respondent is completely satisfied in terms of all
six factors. From past experience, <em>Consumer Reports</em> customer
satisfaction scores have had a population standard deviation, regardless
of store, of 12. We assume that customer satisfaction scores are
normally distributed.</p>
<p>Two independent, random samples were taken. A random sample of 25 Target
customers had a mean customer satisfaction score of 79. A random sample
of 30 Walmart customers had a mean customer satisfaction score of 71.</p>
<p>Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine whether the
population mean customer satisfaction score for Target is higher than
the population mean customer satisfaction score for Walmart at the
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .01\)</span> significance level. Use Target customers as Population 1.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>
<p>A winery was interested in the difference between white wine and red
wine drinkers when it comes to average weekly wine consumption. Two
random, independent samples were taken. A random sample of 35 white wine
drinkers drank a mean of 17.6 ounces of wine per week with a standard
deviation of 4.2. A random sample of 38 red wine drinkers drank a mean
of 14.7 ounces of wine per week with a standard deviation of 3.64.</p>
<p>Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weekly
wine consumption of white wine drinkers differs from the mean weekly
wine consumption of red wine drinkers at the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .05\)</span> significance
level. Consider the white wine drinkers to be Population 1.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis Testing for the Difference between Two Population Proportions: Exercise</h3>
<p>A heart rate monitor manufacturer offers a service for users to upload

<h2>Confidence Intervals</h2>
<p><strong>Hypothesis tests</strong> are one way to draw inferences about population
parameters from sample statistics. Hypothesis tests can answer questions
about whether parameters are equal to or not equal to one other, greater
than one another, or less than one another.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence interval estimates</strong> are another way to draw inferences about
population parameters from sample statistics. Confidence intervals give
us information about what the difference between two population
parameters actually is, to a specified degree of certainty. In the case
of difference in means, the <strong>confidence interval estimate</strong> gives
<strong>a range that contains the true difference between two population means.</strong></p>
<p>Confidence intervals are always calculated at a given level of
confidence, which is a percentage that is related to the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
significance level. <em>The percent confidence is</em> <span class="math inline">\(100(1-\alpha)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This table shows the conversions between some typical <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
significance levels and the corresponding confidence levels:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"><strong><span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\alpha}\)</span> significance level</strong></th>
<th align="center"><strong>Confidence level (%)</strong></th>

<td align="center">95%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">0.01</td>
<td align="center">99%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can calculate these conversions yourself. For example, if
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \ 0.01,\)</span> the confidence level is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[100(1 - \alpha) = 100(1 - 0.01) = 100(0.99) = .99\%\]</span></p>
<p>A <strong>confidence interval</strong> consists of two parts: a <strong><em>point estimate</em></strong>
plus or minus a <strong>margin of error</strong>. A point estimate is a single
number that estimates a population parameter. The margin of error
determines the range around the point estimate. In the equations that
follow, the point estimate is the part before the <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> and the margin
of error is the part following it.</p>
<p>The point estimate minus the margin of error is the <strong>lower bound (LB)</strong>
of the confidence interval, and the point estimate plus the
margin of error is the <strong>upper bound (UB)</strong>. Confidence intervals are
usually reported in square brackets, with the bounds separated by a
comma, as in <strong>[LB, UB].</strong></p>

<h3>Confidence Intervals for Differences: Exercises</h3>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p>
<p>Do Android or iPhone users differ in how many apps they download per
month? What is the difference between them? An analyst takes two
independent, random samples: one of Android users and one of iPhone
users. The sample of 50 Android users downloaded a mean of 2.4 apps per
month. The sample of 55 iPhone users downloaded a mean of 3.7 apps per
month. Historical data suggest that the population standard deviation
for Android users is 1 app per month, and the population standard
deviation for iPhone users is 1.2 apps per month.</p>
<p>Calculate and interpret the 95% confidence interval estimate for the
difference in mean apps downloaded per month between Android and iPhone
users. Assign population 1 to be iPhone users.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>
<p>An HR manager would like to know how much the mean number of overtime
hours differs between employees that have children at home and those who
don’t have children at home. The manager takes a random sample of 35
employees with children at home and finds that these employees work a
mean of 4.2 overtime hours and have a standard deviation of 4 hours. An
independent random sample of 40 employees without children at home has a
mean of 6.5 overtime hours and a standard deviation of 5.9 hours.</p>
<p>Calculate and interpret a 99% confidence interval estimate for the
difference in mean overtime hours between these two groups. Use
employees with children at home as Population 1. The t-distribution
appropriate for use in this instance has 68 degrees of freedom. (On your
own time, calculate out the degrees of freedom – remember to <em>always
round down</em> when calculating degrees of freedom this way!!)</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong></p>
<p>A heart rate monitor manufacturer offers a service for users to upload

manufacturer is interested in different groups of athletes and how they
compare in using this upload service. The company would like to know:
what is the difference between the proportions of triathletes and
cyclists who upload their workout data? Random, independent samples of
triathletes and cyclists were taken. In a sample of 301 triathletes, 239
