<h2>Formulating Hypotheses: What is the difference?</h2>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>An article suggests that Business School students take more credit hours
on average per semester than students in the liberal arts and sciences.
An analyst wishes to see whether this is true at Wayne State. How should
the null and alternative hypotheses be formulated? Use Business School
students as Population 1.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Is there any difference between Mac users and PC users when it comes to
mean customer satisfaction? Formulate the null and alternative
hypotheses that could be used to test this question. Use Mac users as
Population 1.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Sprint advertises that its prices for cell phone service are lower than
Verizon. Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses to test Sprint’s
claim. Use Sprint customers as Population 1.</p>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>
<p>An analyst suspects that, on average, iPhone users download 2 apps per
month more than Android users. If the analyst wants to test for this
difference, what should the null and alternative hypotheses be? (HINT:
the test must determine whether the difference between the mean apps
downloaded by iPhone users and Android users is 2 or not). Use iPhone
users as Population 1.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Two Population Means: Exercises</h3>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p>
<p><em>Using data from Chapter 10, Exercise 7 (although changing the question
asked)</em></p>
<p><em>Consumer Reports</em> uses a survey of readers to obtain customer
satisfaction ratings for the nation’s largest retailers (<em>Consumer
Reports</em>, March 2012). Each survey respondent is asked to rate a
specified retailer in terms of six factors: quality of products,
selection, value, checkout efficiency, service, and store layout. An
overall satisfaction score summarizes the rating for each respondent
with 100 meaning the respondent is completely satisfied in terms of all
six factors. From past experience, <em>Consumer Reports</em> customer
satisfaction scores have had a population standard deviation, regardless
of store, of 12. We assume that customer satisfaction scores are
normally distributed.</p>
<p>Two independent, random samples were taken. A random sample of 25 Target
customers had a mean customer satisfaction score of 79. A random sample
of 30 Walmart customers had a mean customer satisfaction score of 71.</p>
<p>Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine whether the
population mean customer satisfaction score for Target is higher than
the population mean customer satisfaction score for Walmart at the
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .01\)</span> significance level. Use Target customers as Population 1.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>
<p>A winery was interested in the difference between white wine and red
wine drinkers when it comes to average weekly wine consumption. Two
random, independent samples were taken. A random sample of 35 white wine
drinkers drank a mean of 17.6 ounces of wine per week with a standard
deviation of 4.2. A random sample of 38 red wine drinkers drank a mean
of 14.7 ounces of wine per week with a standard deviation of 3.64.</p>
<p>Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weekly
wine consumption of white wine drinkers differs from the mean weekly
wine consumption of red wine drinkers at the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .05\)</span> significance
level. Consider the white wine drinkers to be Population 1.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis Testing for the Difference between Two Population Proportions: Exercise</h3>
<p>A heart rate monitor manufacturer offers a service for users to upload
their workout data and analyze it using a web-based app. The
manufacturer is interested in different groups of athletes and how they
compare in using this upload service. The question is: do triathletes
and pure runners differ in terms of the proportion that uses the upload
service?</p>
<p>Random, independent samples of triathletes and pure runners were taken.
In a sample of 292 triathletes, 79.45% used the upload service. In a
sample of 315 pure runners, 72.38% used the upload service.</p>
<p>Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine whether triathletes
and pure runners differ in the proportion that uses the upload service
for their workout data. Use an <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .01\)</span> significance level. Assign
triathletes as Population 1 and pure runners as Population 2.</p>
