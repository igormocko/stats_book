[Calculating the ANOVA Test Statistic and Summary Table]{.underline}

We calculate the F test statistic from the sample data. In ANOVA, this
is no easy task. It involves a series

of new equations and careful attention to detail.

NOTE: A *balanced design* is one in which all the groups are the same
size (all have the same $n$). An *unbalanced design* is one in which at
least one group is a different size than the others. The book and
MindTap use two different sets of equations for calculating the
$F_{\text{test}}$ in ANOVA, and one set **only** works if you have a
balanced design. **The formulas in this handout will work properly no
matter which design is being used, so I recommend you just stick with
these.**

[For the following equations]{.underline}:

There are $k$ treatment groups. Each group has a sample size, called
$n_{j}$ for the jth treatment group (e.g. the second treatment group has
a sample size of $n_{2}$). Keep this notation in mind.

The $\mathbf{\text{F\ }}$**test statistic** has a **numerator** and a
**denominator** that must be calculated separately.

1.  **[The numerator of the F test statistic is the MSTR:]{.underline}**

    -   Recall: the MSTR is the Mean Square due to Treatments, also
        called the between-treatments estimate of the variance. This is
        the estimate of the true variance under the assumption that
        $H_{0}$ is true, which would mean that all the group population
        means were equal.

> Here are the **four** steps to calculate the $\mathbf{\text{MSTR}}$:

1)  $First,\ calculate\ the\ total\ sample\ size,n_{T}\ :$

$$\text{\ \ }n_{T} = n_{1} + n_{2} + \ldots + n_{k}$$

> NOTE: The total sample size, $n_{T}\ $is just the sum of the sample
> sizes of each group

1)  $Second,\ calculate\ the\ overall\ sample\ mean,\overset{̿}{\overline{x}}\ :\ $

$$\overset{̿}{\overline{x}} = \ \frac{n_{1}{\overline{x}}_{1} + \ n_{2}{\overline{x}}_{2} + \ldots + n_{k}{\overline{x}}_{k}}{n_{T}}\ $$

$${\text{where\ }n_{1},\ n_{2},\ldots,n_{k} = sample\ size\ for\ each\ group\ 
}{{\overline{x}}_{1},\ {\overline{x}}_{2},\ldots,{\overline{x}}_{k} = the\ sample\ mean\ for\ each\ group}$$

> NOTE:
> $\overset{̿}{\overline{x}} = the\ overall\ sample\ mean,\ is\ also\ called\ the\ Grand\ Mean,\ or\ x\text{-}\text{triple}\text{-}\text{bar}$
>
> 3\)
> $Third,\ calculate\ the\ Sum\ of\ Squares\ due\ to\ Treatments,\ SSTR:$

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  $$SSTR = \ \sum_{j = 1}^{k}{n_{j}\ ({\overline{x}}_{j} - \ \overset{̿}{\overline{x}}})^{2}$$   $${\text{where\ }n_{j} = sample\ size\ for\ group\ j
                                                                                                }{{\overline{x}}_{j} = the\ sample\ mean\ for\ group\ j
                                                                                                }{k = the\ number\ of\ groups}$$
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

> 4\) $Finally,\ use\ the\ SSTR\ to\ calculate\ the\ MSTR:$

$$MSTR = \ \frac{\text{SSTR}}{k - 1}$$

$$\text{where\ k} = the\ number\ of\ groups
$$

2.  **[The denominator of the]{.underline}** $\mathbf{F}$ **[test
    statistic is the]{.underline}**
    $\mathbf{\text{MSE}}$**[:]{.underline}**

-   The MSE is the Mean Square due to Error, also called the
    within-treatments estimate of the variance. This is the estimate of
    the true variance under the assumption that $H_{0}$ is false, which
    would mean that at least one group population mean was different
    than the others.

> Here are the **two** steps to calculate the $\mathbf{\text{MSE}}$:

1)  First, calculate the Sum of Squares due to Error, $\text{SSE}$:

$$SSE = \sum_{j = 1}^{k}{(n_{j} - 1)(s_{j}^{2})}$$

$${\text{where\ }n_{j} = the\ sample\ size\ of\ group\ j
}{s_{j}^{2} = the\ sample\ variance\ of\ group\ j
}{k = the\ number\ of\ groups}$$

> 2\) Second, use the $\text{SSE}$ to calculate the $\text{MSE}$:

$$MSE = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n_{T} - k}$$

3.  **[Now calculate the test statistic,]{.underline}**
    $\mathbf{F}_{\mathbf{\text{test}}}$**[:]{.underline}**

$$\mathbf{F}_{\mathbf{\text{test}}}\mathbf{=}\frac{\mathbf{\text{MSTR}}}{\mathbf{\text{MSE}}}$$

**with**

$${\mathbf{numerator\ degrees\ of\ freedom = d}\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{= k - 1}
}{\mathbf{denominator\ degrees\ of\ freedom = d}\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{- k}}$$

In the process of calculating the ANOVA test statistic, we organize all
of the results of our calculations into an ANOVA table. ANOVA tables may
be labeled with different terminology (e.g. the book uses different
labels than Excel) but the numbers always represent the same
calculations.
