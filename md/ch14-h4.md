**[Simple Linear Regression: An Example]{.underline}**

We begin with a **research question** defining what we are investigating
with regression: Does the time students spend on MindTap help explain
(that is to say, predict) their grades?

We will use an $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level for this regression
analysis.

This question defines our variables and the relationship that we are
investigating. Here the variables are:

-   **Dependent variable**: $y = Overall\ MindTap\ Score\ (\%\ points)$

-   **Independent variable**: $x = Time\ spent\ logged\ on\ (hrs)$

The dataset collected is a random sample of $n = 24$ students enrolled
in BA 3400. For each student, time spent logged on to MindTap (in hours)
and overall MindTap score (in points) was recorded. Here is the dataset:

  **Student \#**   **Hours**   **Score**
  ---------------- ----------- -----------
  1                20.85       88.80
  2                10.65       85.40
  3                25.72       99.60
  4                7.75        68.10
  5                18.28       78.40
  6                11.62       75.10
  7                17.30       78.50
  8                15.03       84.30
  9                9.60        77.20
  10               10.93       90.40

  13               17.72       98.50
  14               9.57        71.90
  15               14.60       86.00
  16               16.45       85.60
  17               6.77        63.00
  18               12.07       85.90
  19               13.00       83.20
  20               22.00       97.30
  21               4.92        81.80
  22               14.67       86.10
  23               22.00       87.00
  24               24.90       90.50

After the data collection step, the next thing to do is to graph a
scatterplot of Scores vs Time Spent. In the scatterplot, we are chiefly
concerned with non-linear patterns -- if we see those, then we cannot
use linear regression to analyze this data. We may also be able to
identify a trend in the data that will give us an idea about the
relationship between these two variables. Here is the scatterplot:

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

Do you see any nonlinear patterns?

Do you see a trend in the data? What sign do you expect on the slope of
the regression line?

At this point, we can run the regression in Excel (Demo). See the next
page for the results!

Using the Regression Output Equations Roadmap, identify $b_{0}$ and
$b_{1}$ on this output. Then write the Estimated Regression Equation
(Remember, the ERE is
$\widehat{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x}$):

Before we can use this equation for prediction or interpret the slope,
we must confirm that there is a statistically significant relationship
between MindTap Score (y) and Time Spent (x) **in the population**.
(Remember, if the slope of a line is zero, then there is no relationship
between x and y. If the slope of a line is a number other than zero,
then there *is* a relationship between x and y.)

Here is the Coefficients Table again:

The sample slope $b_{1}$ is 1.1151 which is definitely not zero... so
that means there is a relationship between Hours and Score, right? Not
necessarily! That sample slope just reflects what is going on in this
sample of 24 students. We have to use this sample slope to prove that
the **population slope** $\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{1}}$ is not zero. If
proven, then that would mean there is a statistically significant
relationship between Hours and Score in the **whole population of BA
3400 students**, not just in these 24 students that were in the sample.
That is what we need to prove before using the regression to explain or
predict anything.

Perform the hypothesis test detailed in **Ch 14: Handout \#2** to
determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship
between Hours and Score in the population:

Now that we have confirmed that Hours and Score are related in the
population, we can use our Estimated Regression Equation (ERE) to
predict student scores, and we can interpret the slope $b_{1}.$

First, let's write down the ERE again:

If 11 hours are spent on MindTap, what is the predicted score? Interpret
this value.

Interpret the slope $b_{1}.$

Report and interpret the confidence interval for the population slope
$\beta_{1}.$ Since we are doing this regression at the $\alpha = 0.01$
significance level, which is a 99% confidence level, we should report
and interpret the 99% confidence interval:

**[But there is more to regression than that...]{.underline}**

The existence of a significant relationship between y and x is a
necessary step -- after all, if you cannot confirm a relationship
between the IV and the DV, then the regression is no good for anything
-- but it is not sufficient to stop there. We need a way to judge the
quality of the model. How well does it fit the data? Does it make
accurate predictions? How much of the variation in y does x explain?
Such questions are answered in the Regression Statistics table. But to
understand the Regression Statistics table, we need to understand how
the regression line (the estimated model) is calculated.

Linear regression calculates the estimated regression equation which
[minimizes]{.underline} the squared vertical distance between each
observed value of $y$ in the sample (each $y_{i}$) and the regression
line, at every value of $x_{i}$ in the dataset. This vertical distance
between **observed and predicted y** is a very important quantity in
regression, called the **Residual** and it is calculated by taking the
difference between the observed and predicted values of y for a given
observation:

$$\text{At\ a\ given\ value\ of\ }x_{i},\ the\mathbf{\ residual =}\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{-}{\widehat{\mathbf{y}}}_{\mathbf{i}}$$

Mathematically speaking, the regression line satisfies the Least Squares
Criterion, which is:

$$Least\ Squares\ Criterion = min\sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - {\widehat{y}}_{i} \right)^{2}$$

So, the regression procedure minimizes the sum of the squared residuals.
**Conceptually, the estimated regression equation that linear regression
calculates is the line that is as close as possible to all the points in
the data set at once: that is what it means to satisfy the Least Squares
Criterion.** The regression line that satisfies the Least Squares
Criterion is called the best-fit line.

Let's calculate some residuals for the MindTap data, to gain insight
into what regression is doing and thereby understand what the output
tells us. Here is part of the MindTap dataset, along with the graph of
the data with the regression line:

Find Student \#3 on the graph. Calculate the residual for this student.

The regression procedure uses the residuals for all 24 students in its
placement of the regression line. It takes all the residuals into
account at once, squares them (why?), sums them, and places the line
where that sum is the smallest it can be. This sum of the squared
residuals is extremely important, then! And that is why it is reported
in the ANOVA table in the regression output. It is called the **Sum of
Squares due to Error** or the **Residual Sum of Squares,** and it is
notated as the **SSE.**

$$\mathbf{\text{SSE}} = \sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - {\widehat{y}}_{i} \right)^{2}$$

$$\text{with\ d}f_{2} = n - p - 1$$

Let's take a look at the ANOVA table from the MindTap regression output.
(Refer to the *Regression Output Equations Roadmap* throughout). Where
is the SSE and its degrees of freedom?

  ANOVA                                               
  ------------ ------ ---------- ---------- --------- ------------------
  * *          *df*   *SS*       *MS*       *F*       *Significance F*
  Regression   1      884.5979   884.5979   20.1839   0.0002
  Residual     22     964.1917   43.8269              
  Total        23     1848.79                         

The other values in the ANOVA table are also important in what we are
building towards -- that is, assessing the quality of this model.

The **Total Sum of Squares,** $\mathbf{SST,}\ $is the total amount of
prediction error we would make if we used $\overline{y}$ (the mean of
$y_{i}$) to predict the observed sample data. Where is the SST and its
*df* in the ANOVA table?

-   The $SST = \sum_{}^{}\left( y_{i} - \overline{y} \right)^{2}$, and
    has degrees of freedom $df = n - 1$

The **Sum of Squares due to Regression,** $\mathbf{SSR,}$ is how much we
will reduce prediction error by using the Estimated Regression Equation
instead of the mean to predict the observed sample data. Where is the
SSR and its *df* in the ANOVA table?

-   The
    $SSR = \sum_{}^{}\left( {\widehat{y}}_{i} - \overline{y} \right)^{2}$,
    and has degrees of freedom $df_{1} = p$

The **Mean Square Error,** $\mathbf{MSE,}$ is the estimate of the
variance of $\epsilon$. Remember $\epsilon?$ It is the random error term
in the Regression Model: $y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \epsilon$. Where
is the MSE in the ANOVA table?

-   The $MSE = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n - p - 1}$

**[Putting this all together to explain the ANOVA table in
regression:]{.underline}**

-   recall: the sample data is our best representation of the underlying
    population, so if our model is good at predicting the sample values,
    we can infer it will also be good at predicting population values

-   The ANOVA table in the regression output compares two different
    methods of predicting the sample data in an effort to help us assess
    the quality of our regression model. We assess the regression by
    comparing its predictions to the next best alternative

    -   Premise: there are two different models you could use to predict
        $y$. One model includes information about $x$ and one does not:

        -   First, you could use the Estimated Regression Equation to
            predict $y$ (in other words, predict ${\widehat{y}}_{i}$
            $\ $at each $x_{i}$)

        -   Second, you could use the next best option, which is to just
            use the mean of $\overline{y}$ to predict $y$ at each
            $x_{i}$

            -   This is also called the 'Intercept only model' because
                the equation of $\text{y\ }$does not include any $x$
                variables, thus being only an intercept, and
                representing a horizontal line at $y = \ \overline{y}$.

-   The ANOVA table reports the total errors made when predicting the
    actual observed data using each of these models. In this way, we can
    compare the two possible models and decide whether our regression
    model is worth using.

So now that we have more understanding of what is in the ANOVA table, we
should not be surprised to see all of these values showing up in the
Regression Statistics table in the output, which contains the model fit
stats we need.
