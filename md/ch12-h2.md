**[Goodness-of-Fit Test for a Single Categorical Variable]{.underline}**

Goodness-of-Fit tests test whether or not a categorical variable fits a
particular multinomial probability distribution. A multinomial
probability distribution gives the probabilities for three or more
categorical outcomes of a given variable. The multinomial probability
distribution for a variable with $\text{k\ }$categorical outcomes is:

$${\text{p}_{\mathbf{1}} = P_{1} = probability\ of\ an\ outcome\ being\ in\ category\ 1
}{\text{p}_{\mathbf{2}} = P_{2} = probability\ of\ an\ outcome\ being\ in\ category\ 2
}{\ldots
}{\text{p}_{\mathbf{k}} = P_{k} = probability\ of\ an\ outcome\ being\ in\ category\ k}$$

> where

$$P_{1},P_{2},\ldots,P_{k}\ are\ probabilities\ between\ 0\ and\ 1$$

$$k = the\ number\ of\ categories\ in\ the\ variable$$

1.  **[Formulating the Hypotheses]{.underline}**: There is only one set
    of hypotheses for goodness-of-fit tests, and it incorporates a
    multinomial probability distribution. You **must fill in the
    probabilities** $(P_{1},\ P_{2},\ \ldots,\ P_{k})$ for each problem.

2.  **[The Test Statistic]{.underline}:**

> Here is the idea behind Goodness of Fit tests: if the null hypothesis
> is true, then the multinomial probability distribution in
> $H_{0}\ $truly describes the population. This means that the observed
> frequencies from the sample should be the same as (or very close to)
> the expected frequencies calculated from the $H_{0}\ $probability
> distribution. (For example, if 25% of the population fits into
> Category A, then about 25% of the sample should fit into Category A.)
> Large differences between the observed frequencies and the expected
> frequencies are evidence that the underlying population is NOT
> distributed according to the hypothetical multinomial probability
> distribution.
>
> Some variation between observed and expected frequencies will occur
> due to random chance, so we need to use our hypothesis testing
> techniques to see if the differences we see are *statistically
> significant.* The $\text{Î±\ significance\ level}$ sets a threshold at
> which we determine the sample distribution to be different enough from
> what we would expect under the null hypothesis, to contradict the null
> hypothesis.
>
> The size of the difference between the observed and expected
> frequencies is quantified in our $\chi^{2}\ $test statistic. When the
> test statistic is large enough to reject the null, we can conclude
> that the population is not distributed according to the hypothetical
> multinomial probability distribution.
>
> The test statistic for a Goodness-of-Fit Test is:

$$\chi_{\text{test}}^{2} = \sum_{i = 1}^{k}\frac{\left( f_{i} - e_{i} \right)^{2}}{e_{i}}$$

$$\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ where}$$

$${e_{i} = nP_{i} = the\ expected\ frequency\ for\ category\ i
}{f_{i} = the\ observed\ \left( \text{sample} \right)\text{frequency\ for\ category\ i}
}{k = the\ number\ of\ categories
}{n = sample\ size}$$

$$\text{and}$$

$$the\ degrees\ of\ freedom\ are\ df = k - 1$$

3.  **[Deciding whether or not to Reject]{.underline}**
    $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{0}}$**:**

> Only large discrepancies between the observed and expected frequencies
> constitute evidence against the null hypothesis, so all
> Goodness-of-Fit tests are **[upper tail tests]{.underline}.** (If the
> test statistic was in the lower tail, that would mean there were only
> small discrepancies between observed and expected).

**[Assumptions Underlying These Hypothesis Tests]{.underline}**

All hypothesis tests use sampling distributions to determine the
probability of sample statistics. In order for us to be confident that
our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way
the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If
the assumptions are not met -- that is, if any given assumption is not
true -- then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They
may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the
wrong conclusions.

For Goodness-of-Fit Tests, the only assumption that must be satisfied is
that the expected frequency for each category must be greater than five:

$$e_{i} \geq 5$$

*Exercise:* A bike shop sells bikes with frames made from four different
materials: carbon fiber, aluminum, steel, and titanium. In the past, the
share of sales by type of frame was 17% carbon fiber, 53% aluminum, 12%
steel, and 18% titanium. The bike shop decided to use a Goodness-of-Fit
test at the $\mathbf{\alpha = 0.05}$ **significance level** to see
whether the probability of sales by frame type has changed from what it
was in the past. In a random sample of 250 bike sales, the following
frequencies were observed:

  **Category**   **Frame Type**   **Number of bikes sold**
  -------------- ---------------- --------------------------
  1              Carbon Fiber     66
  2              Aluminum         128
  3              Steel            16
  4              Titanium         40

Start by formulating the null and alternative hypotheses:

From the null hypothesis, fill in the Hypothesized Probability column.

From the sample data, fill in the Observed Frequency column.

For each row, the Expected Frequency is
$e_{i} = n\left( P_{\text{i\ }} \right).$

The sum of the values in the last column is the $\chi^{2}$ test
statistic. The test statistic and the critical value have *k* -- 1
degrees of freedom, where *k* is the number of categories.

Now you are ready to complete the hypothesis test.

(left blank for hypothesis test)

Because we have determined that the distribution has changed from what
it was in the past, the bike shop now wants more details. Which
categories have seen the biggest changes? What adjustments should be
made to inventory?
