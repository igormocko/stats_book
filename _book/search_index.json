["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Definitions and Notation A population is the group of all objects (or subjects) of interest. In a statistical study, the population is defined by the researcher. For example, a population might be defined as all women between 18 and 34 in Michigan, if a researcher was interested in studying that group of subjects. A sample is a subset of the population. For example, a sample from this population could be 100 randomly selected women between 18 and 34 in Michigan. While it is populations that we are ultimately interested in knowing about, we usually do not observe them directly. Instead, samples are what we actually observe and measure in statistical studies. Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about a population, based on a sample taken from that population. Why is randomization important? Only random samples can provide the basis for statistical inference, because only random samples are representative of the population as a whole. It should be clear from the foregoing discussion that we will be dealing with characteristics of populations and characteristics of samples from those populations in this class. Therefore, it will be important to differentiate carefully between them. We do that by using different terms (when possible) and different notation (always) when referring to populations and samples. A parameter is a characteristic of a population. A sample statistic is a characteristic of a sample. For example, the mean of a population is a parameter, while the mean of a sample is a sample statistic. Both are averages, but they are measured on two different groups, and so they are two different things. Characteristics measured on samples estimate the corresponding characteristics of the populations those samples came from. Sample statistics, in other words, are estimates of their corresponding population parameters. The values of sample statistics almost always differ slightly from the values of the corresponding parameters in the underlying population due to random variation, also called random error. So, even a representative, random sample is likely to differ slightly from the underlying population. Suppose you had a population with a mean of 10. Further suppose that you took 5 different random samples from it. In the first sample, just randomly, a few more low values might be chosen. So the mean of the sample would come out a little lower than the population mean, like 9.4. But then in the second sample, a few higher values might be chosen instead. So then the second sample would come out with a mean on the high side, like 10.2. And so it would go with the other three samples – each one chosen randomly, each slightly different from the other samples, and from the underlying population they all came from. In the process of statistical inference, it will be our task to distinguish between this type of random variation, due to random chance, and true variation that can give us information about the value of a population parameter. We will do this by using a technique called hypothesis testing. Notation is a part of life when learning statistics, and you should approach it like learning a language. The symbols are shorthand ways to refer to important concepts. You will need to become familiar with the following notation: +———————————+———————————+ | Population | Sample | | Parameters | Statistics | +================+================+================+================+ | \\[ | The mean of a | \\]| The mean of a | | \\[ | population | {\\mathbf{x}}\\] | sample | | | | | | | | The Greek | | Pronounced “x | | | letter”mu“, | | bar” | | | pronounced | | | | | “mew” | | | +—————-+—————-+—————-+—————-+ | \\[\\ma | The standard | \\]\\[ | The standard | | thbf{\\sigma}\\] | deviation of a | | deviation of a | | | population | | sample | | | | | | | | The lowercase | | | | | Greek letter | | | | | “sigma” | | | +—————-+—————-+—————-+—————-+ | \\[\\m | The variance | \\]^ | The variance | | athbf{}^ | of a | {}\\[ | of a sample | | {\\mathbf{2}}\\] | population | | | | | | | | | | “Sigma | | | | | squared” | | | +—————-+—————-+—————-+—————-+ | \\[\\mathbf{p}\\] | A proportion | \\[\\overline | A proportion | | | of a | {\\mathbf{p}}\\] | of a sample | | | population | | | | | | | Pronounced “p | | | | | bar” | +—————-+—————-+—————-+—————-+ | \\[\\m | The slope | \\]\\[ | The slope | | athbf{\\beta}\\] | coefficient | | coefficient | | | for a | | for a sample | | | population | | | | | | | | | | The Greek | | | | | letter “beta” | | | +—————-+—————-+—————-+—————-+ More Notation \\[\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\] The null hypothesis Pronounced “H nought” or “H O” \\[\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{A}}\\] The alternative hypothesis Pronounced “H A” for short \\[\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\] A significance level The Greek letter “alpha” \\[\\mathbf{n}\\] A sample size p \\(\\mathbf{\\text{or}}\\) P a probability \\[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\] The summation operator The uppercase Greek letter “sigma” Read this as “The sum of all….” \\[\\mathbf{\\Delta}\\] Read this as “the change in…” The Greek letter “delta” \\[\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\] A variable with a subscript A subscript denotes one of several variables The \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\text{\\ x}\\), pronounced “\\(x\\) sub \\(i\\)” or \"\\(\\text{x\\ i}\\)\" for short For example: \\(x_{2}\\) is the 2nd \\(x\\) in a set of \\(x\\) variables and could be called “\\(x\\) sub 2” or “\\(x\\) 2” \\[\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}\\] A variable with a hat This example is pronounced “y hat” \\[\\mathbf{\\text{ε\\ or\\ ϵ}}\\] Random error The Greek letter “epsilon” \\[\\mathbf{&gt;}\\] greater than \\[\\mathbf{&lt;}\\] less than \\[\\mathbf{\\geq}\\] greater than or equal to \\[\\mathbf{\\leq}\\] less than or equal to \\[\\mathbf{\\neq}\\] not equal to "],
["the-z-distribution.html", "The z Distribution", " The z Distribution The \\(z\\) distribution, also called the standard normal distribution, is a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. It is used to standardize values in order to determine their probability. Probability in a \\(z\\) distribution is represented as the area between the curve and the horizontal axis – often called the area under the curve. (This is actually true of all probability distributions – they all use area under the curve to measure probability). Let’s draw a \\(z\\) distribution and label some of its important features: \\(z\\) values are in units of standard deviations, so they express how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular value is. For example, a value that standardizes to a \\(z\\) of \\(2.0\\) is two standard deviations above the mean, while a value that standardizes to a \\(z\\) of \\(- 1.6\\) is \\(1.6\\) standard deviations below the mean. The \\(z\\) table is used to look up probabilities for different values of \\(z\\). The probability of a value falling at or above a given \\(z\\) is called the upper tail probability, or upper tail p-value. The probability of a value falling at or below a given \\(z\\) is called the lower tail probability, or lower tail p-value. The probability of a value falling a given distance away from the mean in either tail is called the two-tailed p-value (don’t worry – there will be more on this one later). These p-values will be very important in hypothesis testing, where they will be the evidence in the p-value approach to rejecting the null hypothesis. Example 1. What is the probability that a randomly drawn z value would be greater than or equal to 1.24? This is what is called the upper tail p-value of \\(z = 1.24\\) Example 2. What is the probability that a randomly drawn z value would be less than or equal to \\(- 1.84\\)? This is what is called the lower tail p-value of \\(z = - 1.84.\\) Example 3. What is the probability that a randomly drawn z value would be at least \\(2.15\\) standard deviations away from the mean? This is what is called a two-tailed p-value. Now it is your turn! Try the three exercises below. Exercise 1. What is the UT p-value of \\(z = 2.50\\)? Exercise 2. What is the LT p-value of \\(z = - 1.00\\)? Exercise 3. What is the 2T p-value of \\(z = - 2.82\\)? Critical Values of Z Critical Values (CVs) are values of \\(z\\) with given tail probabilities. In notation, Critical Values are always subscripted with a probability. In general, \\(\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathbf{\\alpha}}\\) is the CV of \\(z\\) with \\(\\alpha\\) probability in the upper tail, and \\(\\mathbf{-}\\mathbf{z}_{\\mathbf{\\alpha}}\\ \\)is the CV of \\(z\\) with \\(\\alpha\\) probability in the lower tail. Some common CVs of \\(z\\) are given in the inset table on the first page of the z table, reproduced here: where \\(\\alpha = \\ \\)the tail probability and \\(z_{\\alpha} = \\ \\)the Critical Value of \\(\\text{z\\ }\\)with \\(\\alpha\\) probability in the tail Example 4. Look up the upper tail CV of \\(\\text{z\\ }\\)at \\(\\alpha = 0.05.\\) Draw and fully label the \\(z\\) distribution showing the CV and shading in the tail probability. Example 5. Look up the lower tail CV of \\(z\\) at \\(\\alpha = 0.01.\\) Draw and fully label the \\(z\\) distribution showing the CV and shading in the tail probability. Example 6. Look up the two-tailed Critical Values of \\(z\\) at \\(\\alpha = 0.05.\\ \\)Draw and fully label the \\(z\\) distribution. Here are the steps to look up the 2T CVs: Split \\(\\alpha\\) between the two tails by dividing \\(\\alpha\\) by 2 Look up the LT CV of \\(\\text{z\\ }\\)at \\(\\alpha/2\\) and the UT CV of \\(\\text{z\\ }\\)at \\(\\alpha/2\\). These are your 2T CVs. Why do we need Critical Values? Critical Values can give us information about the p-value (the probability) of other values of \\(z\\). This use of CVs will be very important in hypothesis testing, where they will be the evidence in the Critical Value approach to rejecting the null hypothesis. What is the UT CV of \\(z\\) at \\(\\alpha = 0.10?\\) Draw and fully label the \\(z\\) distribution. What can this picture tell us about the UT p-value of \\(z = 4.1?\\) "],

["hypothesis-testing-the-process.html", "Hypothesis Testing: The Process", " Hypothesis Testing: The Process A hypothesis test occurs in stages. The logic of hypothesis testing is as follows: Identify a population of interest, a parameter of interest, and a question you have about that parameter Make an assumption about the value of the population parameter you are interested in Examine a random sample from the population to see if it contradicts that assumption If the sample contradicts the assumption, then reject the assumption. Otherwise, do not reject the assumption. (NOTE: you can never prove that the assumption is true in a hypothesis test – you can only prove that it is wrong. Hence: “Reject,” or “Do not reject”) Answer the original question. In practice, these are the steps in a hypothesis test, in which you use a sample to infer information about the value of a population parameter: Formulate a null hypothesis \\(\\mathbf{(}\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\mathbf{)}\\) and an alternative hypothesis \\(\\mathbf{(}\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{A}}\\mathbf{)}\\) according to the question you want to answer about the population parameter of interest. The null hypothesis is an assumption about the value of the population parameter; the alternative hypothesis is the mathematical opposite of the null hypothesis. Calculate the Test-Statistic. In this step, you standardize information from the sample against the appropriate sampling distribution. Decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. Determine the probability of getting that Test-Statistic (in other words, that sample), assuming that the null hypothesis is true. If the probability is less than the \\(\\alpha\\) significance level, then reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. Otherwise, do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the alternative hypothesis is unsupported. Interpret the hypothesis test in order to answer the original question. "],
["hypothesis-tests-about-a-single-population-mean.html", "Hypothesis Tests about a Single Population Mean", " Hypothesis Tests about a Single Population Mean Formulating the Hypotheses: The three possible forms of hypotheses each correspond to a different question you might want to ask about the true value of the population mean, \\(\\text{μ.}\\) \\(Note:\\ in\\ each\\ of\\ the\\ hypotheses\\ below,\\ \\mu_{0}\\text{\\ is\\ a\\ number.\\ \\ It\\ is\\ the\\ hypothesized\\ value\\ of\\ μ.\\ }\\) Hypotheses for Hypothesis Tests about a Single Population Mean, \\(\\mu\\) Lower Tail Test Upper Tail Test Two-Tailed Test \\[H_{0}: \\ \\mu \\geq \\mu_{0}\\] \\[H_{ A}:\\ \\mu &lt; \\mu_{0}\\] \\[H_{0}: \\ \\mu \\leq \\mu_{0}\\] \\[H_{ A}:\\ \\mu &gt; \\mu_{0}\\] \\[H_{ 0}:\\ \\mu = \\mu_{0}\\] \\[H_{A}: \\ \\mu \\neq \\mu_{0}\\] Answers Questions About: If the true population mean, \\(\\mu,\\) is less than a given number, \\(\\mu_{0}\\) If the true population mean, \\(\\mu,\\) is greater than a given number, \\(\\mu_{0}\\) If the true population mean, \\(\\mu,\\) is different from a given number, \\(\\mu_{0}\\) Example: Suppose you want to know whether a population mean is more than 3. That matches with the question answered by an upper tail test with a \\(\\mu_{0}\\) of 3. So, the hypotheses would be: \\[\\begin{matrix} H_{0}\\&amp;:\\mu \\leq 3 \\\\ H_{A}\\&amp;:\\mu &gt; 3 \\\\ \\end{matrix}\\] Upper Tail and Lower Tail Tests are called one-tailed or directional tests. Two-tailed tests are called non-directional tests. Calculate the Test Statistic: In this step, we calculate a test statistic from the sample information. The test statistic standardizes the sample, so we can use it to judge our hypotheses. In the case of testing a population mean, there is an additional preliminary step: we have to choose the correct test statistic to use. Every hypothesis test incorporates some information about the variability of the underlying population – otherwise it would be impossible to determine how probable a given sample statistic really is. For hypothesis testing about a single population mean, the correct choice of test statistic depends on the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{x}\\), which in turn depends on what information you have about the variability in the underlying population. While the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma,\\) cannot strictly be known without measuring the entire population and calculating it, sometimes we can assume we know the true value of \\(\\text{σ.\\ }\\)The basis for such an assumption would come from prior knowledge, historical information, or past experience with the population in question. Other times, we might not have knowledge of \\(\\sigma\\). In that case, we can still get some idea about the variability of the underlying population by looking at the standard deviation, \\(s\\), of a random sample taken from that population. After all, a random sample is representative of the population it comes from, so the amount of variability in the population ought to be reflected in the amount of variability in the sample. If we cannot assume we know \\(\\sigma\\), then \\(\\text{s\\ }\\)is our best estimate of the variability in the population. \\(NOTE:s\\) is a measurement on the sample – we calculate it from the sample data. In summary: The population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma,\\) is sometimes assumed to be known from prior knowledge, historical information, or past experience. On the other hand, if \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, then the only information about variability in the underlying population is the standard deviation measured on the sample itself – the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\). In hypothesis testing about a single population mean, it will be your task to carefully identify whether the standard deviation in a given problem refers to a sample or to the population. That will determine which test statistic to use. - **[When]{.underline}** $\\mathbf{\\text{σ\\ }}$**[is KNOWN]{.underline}:** &gt; Under the assumption that $H_{0}$ is true as an equality, the sampling &gt; distribution of the sample mean, $\\overline{x},\\ $follows the $z$ &gt; distribution. Therefore, we standardize the sample against the $z$ &gt; distribution by calculating the following $z$ test statistic: $$z_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu_{0}}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$ &gt; where $${\\overline{x} = the\\ sample\\ mean }{\\mu_{0} = the\\ hypothesized\\ value\\ of\\ \\mu }{\\sigma = the\\ population\\ standard\\ deviation }{n = the\\ sample\\ size}$$ &gt; NOTE: when calculating this equation, evaluate the numerator and &gt; denominator separately, and then divide - **[When]{.underline}** $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ **[is UNKNOWN, then we use]{.underline}** $\\mathbf{s}$ **[instead]{.underline}: [ ]{.underline}** &gt; Under the assumption that $H_{0}$ is true as an equality, the sampling &gt; distribution of the sample mean, $\\overline{x},\\ $follows the $t$ &gt; distribution with $degrees\\ of\\ freedom = n - 1$. Therefore, we &gt; standardize the sample against the $t$ distribution by calculating the &gt; following $t$ test statistic: $$t_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu_{0}}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$ &gt;

There are two approaches to deciding whether or not to reject the &gt; Null: - In the ***p-value approach***, we **compare** the **p-value** of our test statistic to the $\\mathbf{\\alpha}$ **significance level** and reject $H_{0}$ if the p-value is less than or equal to the $\\alpha$ significance level. - In the ***critical value approach***, we **compare** the **test statistic** to **a critical value** -- this can be done with a diagram in which we use the critical value(s) to construct a rejection region or regions; if the test statistic is in a rejection region, we reject $H_{0}$ and accept $H_{A}.$ Or, this step can be accomplished by following the mathematical rules given in the tables below. +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | **When to | | | | | Reject** | | | | | $\\mathbf{H} | | | | | _{\\mathbf{0}}$ | | | | | **for** | | | | | $\\mathbf{z}$ | | | | | **test | | | | | statistics:** | | | | +================+================+================+================+ | | **For a Lower | **For an Upper | **For a | | | Tail Test:** | Tail Test:** | Two-Tailed | | | | | Test:** | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | **p-value | Look up the | Look up the | The two-tailed | | approach:** | lower tail | upper tail | $p\\text{- | | | $p\\text{- | $p\\text{- | }\\text{value}$ | | | }\\text{value}$ | }\\text{value}$ | is two times | | | of | of | the one tailed | | | $z_ | $z_ | p-value of | | | {\\text{test}}$ | {\\text{test}}$ | $z_{ | | | | | \\text{test}}.$ | | | If the | If the | | | | $\\text{LT\\ p}\\ | $\\text{UT\\ p}\\ | If the | | | text{-}value \\ | text{-}value \\ | $2T\\ p\\ | | | leq \\ \\alpha,$ | leq \\ \\alpha,$ | text{-}value \\ | | | then reject | then reject | leq \\ \\alpha,$ | | | $H_{0}$ and | $H_{0}$ and | then | | | accept | accept | | | | $H_{A}.$ | $H_{A}.$ | reject $H_{0}$ | | | | | and accept | | | If the | If the | $H_{A}.$ | | | $\\text{LT\\ | $\\text{UT\\ | | | | p}\\text{-}valu | p}\\text{-}valu | If the | | | e &gt;

(Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis &gt; tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the &gt; parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the &gt; answer to that question. In other words, we must *interpret* the &gt; conclusion of our test in terms of the original question. &gt; &gt; Remember: in hypothesis testing **you can never prove the null &gt; hypothesis**. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: that is, &gt; when you reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your &gt; given $\\alpha$ level of significance you can conclude that $H_{A}$ is &gt; true. If you do reject $H_{0},\\ $then you must conclude that $H_{A}$ &gt; is unsupported by the evidence.

If the assumptions are not met – that is, if any given assumption is not true – then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests.

To determine which tail test to choose, you have to match up the question you have about the population mean with the hypotheses that are the best fit to answer the question. Since you can only prove the Alternative Hypothesis ($H_{A}$), and you cannot ever prove the null hypothesis ($H_{0}$), it is usually helpful to frame your question in terms of the alternative hypothesis. What I mean by that is, you can read each $H_{A}$ aloud in words, and see which one fits the circumstances best. *Example 4.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine whether a population mean is smaller than 14. *Example 5.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine whether a population mean is different than 419. *Example 6.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine whether a population mean has increased from 85. **Now, try it yourself:** *Exercise 4.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine whether a population mean has decreased from 581. *Exercise 5.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine whether a population mean has changed from 74. *Exercise 6.* Formulate the hypotheses for a hypothesis test to determine whether a population mean is higher than 620. Now let&#39;s apply what we&#39;ve learned to actual hypothesis testing scenarios. In order to properly formulate the Null Hypothesis ($H_{0}$) and the Alternative Hypothesis ($H_{A}$), you must: 1) Identify the parameter of interest 2) Identify the question being asked about the parameter of interest and match it to an LT, UT, or 2T test *Example 7:* A shampoo company has introduced a new formula of a particular shampoo. In the past, customers have been regularly surveyed about the shampoo, asked to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 10, and the shampoo has scored a mean of 6.2. An analyst at the company would like to test whether the mean satisfaction score changed after the new formula was introduced. Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses the analyst should use. 1) The parameter of interest is $\\mu:\\ $the population mean customer satisfaction score 2) The question being asked is: has the mean customer satisfaction score changed from what it was before the new formula was introduced (which was 6.2)? The hypotheses will refer to $\\mu$ which is the population mean customer satisfaction score. The analyst wants to test for any change from 6.2 -- if the mean score has changed, then it would be different from (i.e. not equal to) 6.2. Therefore, the proper hypotheses are: $H_{0}:\\ $ $H_{A}:\\ $ *Example 8*: The same situation as Example 1, except this time, the analyst is concerned that the mean customer satisfaction score has fallen with the introduction of the new formula. Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses to test whether the mean satisfaction score has decreased. 1) The parameter of interest is (still) $\\mu:\\ $the population mean customer satisfaction score 2) The question being asked is: has the mean customer satisfaction score decreased from what it was before (which was 6.2)? The hypotheses will still refer to $\\mu$ which is the mean customer satisfaction score of the population. The analyst wants to test for a decrease -- and if the mean score has decreased than it would be less than 6.2. Therefore, the proper form is: $H_{0}:\\ $ $H_{A}:\\ $ *Example 9:* Again, same situation as Example 1. But this time, the analyst would like to prove that the new formula is better than the old formula. That is, the analyst would like to test whether the mean customer satisfaction score has increased. Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses to test whether the mean customer satisfaction score has gone up with the new formula&#39;s introduction. 1) The parameter of interest is (still) $\\mu:\\ $the population mean customer satisfaction score 2) The question being asked is: Has the mean customer satisfaction score increased from what it was before (which was 6.2)? The hypotheses will still refer to $\\mu$ which is the mean customer satisfaction score of the population. The analyst would like to show that this parameter has increased -- and if the mean score has increased than it would be greater than 6.2. Therefore, the hypotheses are: $H_{0}:\\ $ $H_{A}:\\ $ *Example 10:* A manufacturer makes test tubes for laboratory use. These test tubes must hold exactly 10 milliliters (ml) of liquid. A quality control analyst would like to check whether or not the production line is running properly.

["the-t-distribution.html", "The t Distribution", " The t Distribution The t distribution is a probability distribution that is frequently used as a sampling distribution in hypothesis testing. In some ways, it is similar to the z distribution, but it has several key differences as well. The t distribution: has a total area under the curve of one is approximately bell-shaped, but is not normal has a mean of zero is centered on the mean is symmetrical around the mean “as above, so below the mean” upper tail t values are positive, lower tail t values are negative is a family of distributions, so you must decide which t distribution to use The correct distribution to use in each case will be determined by the degrees of freedom (df), which is calculated from information about the sample. We will use the t distribution to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis for t test statistics. For the Critical Value approach, we can look up the CVs on the t table. For the p-value approach, we will use Excel to calculate the p-values for t test statistics (see separate handout). Using the t table: The t table is a table of Critical Values of t at particular tail probabilities. Each row of the t table corresponds to a t distribution with the given degrees of freedom (df). Each column of the t table refers to a different upper tail probability We can use the t table for lower tail Critical Values too. Because the t distribution is symmetrical around the mean of zero, a lower tail Critical Value will be the negative of the upper tail Critical Value with the same tail probability. Example 1. Use the t table to look up the following: The upper tail Critical Value of t at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) with degrees of freedom \\(df = 44\\) The lower tail Critical Value of t at \\(\\alpha = 0.10\\) with degrees of freedom \\(df = 82\\) The two-tailed Critical Values of t at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) with degrees of freedom \\(df = 37\\)* Example 2.

The first concern when dealing with problems about proportions is that proportions are commonly expressed in words as percentages, shares, or fractions. Regardless of how they are expressed in words, they must be converted into mathematical proportions before using them in hypothesis testing. Proportions are always between 0 and 1. To convert a percentage to a proportion, divide the percentage by 100. If a proportion is expressed as a fraction, divide out the fraction to obtain a decimal. A proportion may be expressed as a share, such as 25 out of 72. To convert a share to a proportion, calculate the relative frequency: \\(\\frac{25}{72} = 0.3472.\\) Example 1: Converting a percentage to a proportion 97% of the people in Michigan live in the Lower Peninsula. What proportion of people in Michigan live in the Lower Peninsula? Answer: 97% is a percentage. To convert it to a proportion, divide 97 by 100: \\(p = \\frac{97}{100} = \\mathbf{0.97}\\) Example 2: Converting a share to a proportion A random sample of 38 customers was taken. 23 preferred Brand A.

What proportion of people prefer oranges to apples? Answer: This proportion is expressed as a fraction. To convert it to a proportion, divide it out: \\(p = \\frac{1}{5} = \\mathbf{0.2}\\) For the following exercises, formulate the hypotheses \\(\\left( H_{0}\\text{\\ and\\ }H_{A} \\right)\\ \\)and be sure to express \\(p_{0}\\) correctly as a proportion: Exercise 1: An optician reads an article that states that industry-wide, 3 in 10 customers rate new glasses as “unsatisfactory”.

["type-i-and-type-ii-error.html", "Type I and Type II Error", " Type I and Type II Error We use inferences based on probability to make decisions in hypothesis testing. Basing decisions on probability, and not certainty, introduces the possibility of error – that is, of making incorrect inferences and drawing incorrect conclusions. These are NOT errors in calculation or process – these errors are inherent in hypothesis testing, even if you do everything right. Two types of error in hypothesis testing: Type I Error: Rejecting the null hypothesis (and accepting the alternative hypothesis), when the null hypothesis is actually true. Type II Error: Not rejecting the null hypothesis, when the null hypothesis is actually false. These errors have direct, real-world consequences. If you are testing whether a new program has decreased costs, and a Type I error occurs, then you would conclude that the program decreased costs when it actually had not done so. This could lead your company to prolong an ineffective program. On the other hand, consider the kettlebell hypothesis test we did on Handout #4. In that test we did not reject the null hypotheses, and so we concluded that there was no reason to shut down the manufacturing line. If a Type II error had occurred in that situation, then we would have let the line continue when actually the population mean weight of the bells was not 20lbs, thus leading us to ship product that did not conform to our 20lb specification. This is why hypothesis testing should be done while considering other information and context if at all possible. If a single hypothesis test yields an unexpected result, then another sample should be taken and the test should be repeated. It is highly unlikely that two Type I or Type II errors would occur in successive samples from the same population. The α significance level in a hypothesis test gives the probability of making a Type I error. If you do a hypothesis test at the \\(\\alpha = .01\\) significance level, you have a 0.01 probability (in other words, a 1% chance) of rejecting a null hypothesis that is actually true. To restate that, 1% of the time, a Type I error will happen. Example 1: A shampoo company has introduced a new formula of a particular shampoo. In the past, customers have been regularly surveyed about the shampoo, asked to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 10, and the shampoo has scored a mean of 6.2. An analyst at the company would like to test whether the mean satisfaction score changed after the new formula was introduced. \\(H_{0}:\\ \\mu = 6.2\\) \\(H_{A}:\\ \\mu \\neq 6.2\\) Suppose the analyst did this hypothesis test and, based on the sample, rejected \\(H_{0}\\). However, in reality the population mean customer satisfaction score is 6.2 (i.e. a value that makes the Null Hypothesis true), this would be a Type I Error. If the analyst did a hypothesis test and did not reject \\(H_{0}\\), but in reality the actual population mean customer satisfaction score was 5.1 (i.e. a value that means the Null Hypothesis is not true), this would be a Type II Error. Example 2: A human resources manager is interested in testing the effectiveness of a new training program. Prior to the training, employees could handle an average of 11.65 cases per day. The HR manager would like to determine whether the training has increased the average number of cases employees can handle per work day. \\(H_{0}:\\) \\(H_{A}:\\) If the HR manager did a hypothesis test and did not reject \\(H_{0}\\), but the actual population mean of cases per day was 12, what type of error would this be?

This corresponds to a lower tail test.

Choosing and Calculating the Test Statistic: The sample statistic of interest in hypothesis tests about the difference between two population means is the difference between the two sample means, \\({\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2}.\\) We will need to determine how probable a given difference between two sample means is in order to decide whether or not to reject \\(H_{0}\\). To do that, we will calculate a test statistic using information from both samples, and sometimes from both populations. For hypothesis testing about the difference between two population means, the correct choice of test statistic depends on the sampling distribution of \\({\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2}\\), which in turn depends on what information you have about the variability in the underlying populations. The population standard deviations, \\(\\sigma_{1}\\text{\\ and\\ }\\sigma_{2},\\) are sometimes known from prior knowledge, historical information, or past experience. On the other hand, if \\(\\sigma_{1}\\text{\\ and\\ }\\sigma_{2}\\) are unknown, then we use the information about variability of the samples: the standard deviations measured on the samples themselves, \\(s_{1}\\text{\\ and\\ }s_{2}\\). When \\(\\mathbf{\\sigma}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{\\text{\\ and\\ }}\\mathbf{\\sigma}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{\\ }\\)are KNOWN: Under the assumption that \\(H_{0}\\) is true as an equality, the sampling distribution of the difference between the two sample means, \\({\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2},\\ \\)follows the \\(z\\) distribution. Therefore, we standardize the samples against the \\(z\\) distribution by calculating the following \\(z\\) test statistic: \\[z_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{{(\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2}) - D_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \\ \\frac{\\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}}\\] where \\[{{\\overline{x}}_{1} = the\\ mean\\ of\\ sample\\ 1 }{{\\overline{x}}_{2} = the\\ mean\\ of\\ sample\\ 2 }{D_{0} = the\\ hypothesized\\ difference\\ between\\ the\\ means\\ \\left( \\text{from\\ }H_{0},\\ H_{A} \\right) }{\\sigma_{1} = the\\ standard\\ deviation\\ of\\ population\\ 1 }{\\sigma_{2} = the\\ standard\\ deviation\\ of\\ population\\ 2 }{n_{1} = the\\ sample\\ size\\ of\\ sample\\ 1 }{n_{2} = the\\ sample\\ size\\ of\\ sample\\ 2}\\] When \\(\\mathbf{\\sigma}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{\\text{\\ and\\ }}\\mathbf{\\sigma}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{\\ }\\)are UNKNOWN: Under the assumption that \\(H_{0}\\) is true as an equality, the sampling distribution of the difference between the two sample means, \\({\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2},\\ \\)follows the \\(t\\) distribution with \\(\\text{degrees\\ of\\ freedom}\\) given by the equation below. Therefore, we standardize the samples against the \\(t\\) distribution by calculating the following \\(t\\) test statistic: \\[t_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{{(\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2}) - D_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \\ \\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}}\\] where \\[{{\\overline{x}}_{1} = the\\ mean\\ of\\ sample\\ 1 }{{\\overline{x}}_{2} = the\\ mean\\ of\\ sample\\ 2 }{D_{0} = the\\ hypothesized\\ difference\\ between\\ the\\ means\\ (from\\ H_{0},\\ H_{A}) }{s_{1} = the\\ standard\\ deviation\\ of\\ sample\\ 1 }{s_{2} = the\\ standard\\ deviation\\ of\\ sample\\ 2 }{n_{1} = the\\ sample\\ size\\ of\\ sample\\ 1 }{n_{2} = the\\ sample\\ size\\ of\\ sample\\ 2}\\] and the degrees of freedom are: \\[df = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}} \\right)^{2}}{\\frac{1}{n_{1} - 1}\\left( \\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} \\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{n_{2} - 1}\\left( \\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}} \\right)^{2}}\\] NOTE: if the degrees of freedom has decimal places, **ALWAYS round DOWN to the nearest whole number. Deciding whether or not to Reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\): There are two approaches to deciding whether or not to reject the Null: In the p-value approach, we compare the p-value of our test statistic to the \\(\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\) significance level and reject \\(H_{0}\\) if the p-value is less than or equal to the \\(\\alpha\\) significance level. In the critical value approach, we compare the test statistic to a critical value – this can be done with a diagram in which we use the critical value(s) to construct a rejection region or regions; if the test statistic is in a rejection region, we reject \\(H_{0}\\) and accept \\(H_{A}.\\) Or, this step can be accomplished by following the mathematical rules given in the tables below. When to Reject \\(\\mathbf{H} _{\\mathbf{0}}\\) for \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) test statistics: For a Lower Tail Test: For an Upper Tail Test: For a Two-Tailed Test: p-value approach: Look up the lower tail \\(p\\text{- }\\text{value}\\) of \\(z_ {\\text{test}}\\) If the \\(\\text{LT\\ p}\\ text{-}value \\ leq \\ \\alpha,\\) then reject \\(H_{0}\\) and accept \\(H_{A}.\\) If the \\(\\text{LT\\ p}\\text{-}valu e &gt; \\ \\alpha,\\) then do not reject \\(H_{0};H_{A}\\) is unsupported.

Interpreting the test: (Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the answer to that question. In other words, we must interpret the conclusion of our test in terms of the original question. Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given \\(\\alpha\\) level of significance you may conclude that \\(H_{A}\\) is true. If you do not reject \\(H_{0},\\ \\)then you must conclude that \\(H_{A}\\) is unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how to interpret hypothesis tests: always look at the alternative hypothesis! In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and says either that it is true or that it is unsupported by the evidence.

In order for us to be confident that our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If the assumptions are not met – that is, if any given assumption is not true – then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the wrong conclusions. For the hypothesis tests presented above about the difference between two population means, \\(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2}:\\) Both samples must be random and independent of one another If both populations are normally distributed, then the sample sizes can be small If both populations are not normally distributed, or if one or more of the distributions are unknown, then the sample sizes must both be greater than or equal to 30 \\((n_{1} \\geq 30\\ and\\ n_{2} \\geq 30)\\) When \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) are unknown (that is, when you are using the t distribution): It is recommended to have equal sample sizes, although this is not strictly necessary. If the sample sizes are nearly equal, then having sample sizes that satisfy \\(n_{1} + n_{2} \\geq 20\\) are adequate. if the populations have skewed distributions or have outliers, then the sample sizes must be larger "],

Calculating the Test Statistic: NOTE: The logic is the same as all previous hypothesis tests: we are looking to see whether our sample values contradict the null hypothesis. The sample statistic of interest in hypothesis tests about the difference between two population proportions is the difference between the two sample proportions, \\({\\overline{p}}_{1} - {\\overline{p}}_{2}.\\) In order to decide whether or not to reject \\(H_{0},\\) we need to use a sampling distribution of \\({\\overline{p}}_{1} - {\\overline{p}}_{2}\\) to determine the probability of a given difference between two sample proportions, under the assumption that \\(H_{0}\\) is true as an equality – that is, assuming that the two proportions are equal. If the sample statistic \\({\\overline{p}}_{1} - {\\overline{p}}_{2}\\) is less probable than the \\(\\alpha\\) significance level, then it contradicts the null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)) and we will reject \\(H_{0}\\). (continued on next page) Under the assumption that \\(H_{0}\\) is true as an equality, the sampling distribution of \\({\\overline{p}}_{1} - {\\overline{p}}_{2}\\) follows the \\(z\\) distribution.

An analyst wishes to see whether this is true at Wayne State. How should the null and alternative hypotheses be formulated? Use Business School students as Population 1. Example 2: Is there any difference between Mac users and PC users when it comes to mean customer satisfaction? Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses that could be used to test this question. Use Mac users as Population 1. Example 3: Sprint advertises that its prices for cell phone service are lower than Verizon. Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses to test Sprint’s claim. Use Sprint customers as Population 1. Example 4: An analyst suspects that, on average, iPhone users download 2 apps per month more than Android users. If the analyst wants to test for this difference, what should the null and alternative hypotheses be? (HINT: the test must determine whether the difference between the mean apps downloaded by iPhone users and Android users is 2 or not). Use iPhone users as Population 1. Hypothesis Tests about the Difference between Two Population Means: Exercises Exercise 1: Using data from Chapter 10, Exercise 7 (although changing the question asked) Consumer Reports uses a survey of readers to obtain customer satisfaction ratings for the nation’s largest retailers (Consumer Reports, March 2012). Each survey respondent is asked to rate a specified retailer in terms of six factors: quality of products, selection, value, checkout efficiency, service, and store layout. An overall satisfaction score summarizes the rating for each respondent with 100 meaning the respondent is completely satisfied in terms of all six factors. From past experience, Consumer Reports customer satisfaction scores have had a population standard deviation, regardless of store, of 12. We assume that customer satisfaction scores are normally distributed. Two independent, random samples were taken. A random sample of 25 Target customers had a mean customer satisfaction score of 79. A random sample of 30 Walmart customers had a mean customer satisfaction score of 71. Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine whether the population mean customer satisfaction score for Target is higher than the population mean customer satisfaction score for Walmart at the \\(\\alpha = .01\\) significance level. Use Target customers as Population 1. Exercise 2: A winery was interested in the difference between white wine and red wine drinkers when it comes to average weekly wine consumption. Two random, independent samples were taken. A random sample of 35 white wine drinkers drank a mean of 17.6 ounces of wine per week with a standard deviation of 4.2. A random sample of 38 red wine drinkers drank a mean of 14.7 ounces of wine per week with a standard deviation of 3.64. Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weekly wine consumption of white wine drinkers differs from the mean weekly wine consumption of red wine drinkers at the \\(\\alpha = .05\\) significance level. Consider the white wine drinkers to be Population 1. Hypothesis Testing for the Difference between Two Population Proportions: Exercise A heart rate monitor manufacturer offers a service for users to upload their workout data and analyze it using a web-based app. The manufacturer is interested in different groups of athletes and how they compare in using this upload service. The question is: do triathletes and pure runners differ in terms of the proportion that uses the upload service? Random, independent samples of triathletes and pure runners were taken. In a sample of 292 triathletes, 79.45% used the upload service. In a sample of 315 pure runners, 72.38% used the upload service. Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test to determine whether triathletes and pure runners differ in the proportion that uses the upload service for their workout data.

["confidence-intervals.html", "Confidence Intervals", " Confidence Intervals Hypothesis tests are one way to draw inferences about population parameters from sample statistics. Hypothesis tests can answer questions about whether parameters are equal to or not equal to one other, greater than one another, or less than one another. Confidence interval estimates are another way to draw inferences about population parameters from sample statistics. Confidence intervals give us information about what the difference between two population parameters actually is, to a specified degree of certainty. In the case of difference in means, the confidence interval estimate gives a range that contains the true difference between two population means. Confidence intervals are always calculated at a given level of confidence, which is a percentage that is related to the \\(\\alpha\\) significance level. \\(The\\ percent\\ confidence\\ is\\ 100\\left( 1 - \\alpha \\right)\\%.\\) This table shows the conversions between some typical \\(\\alpha\\) significance levels and the corresponding confidence levels: \\(\\mathbf{\\text{α\\ }}\\)significance level Confidence level (%) 0.10 90% 0.05 95% 0.01 99% You can calculate these conversions yourself.

A point estimate is a single number that estimates a population parameter. The margin of error determines the range around the point estimate. In the equations that follow, the point estimate is the part before the \\(\\pm\\) and the margin of error is the part following it. The point estimate minus the margin of error is the lower bound (LB) of the confidence interval, and the point estimate plus the margin of error is the upper bound (UB).

Confidence Intervals for Differences: Exercises Exercise 1: Do Android or iPhone users differ in how many apps they download per month? What is the difference between them? An analyst takes two independent, random samples: one of Android users and one of iPhone users. The sample of 50 Android users downloaded a mean of 2.4 apps per month. The sample of 55 iPhone users downloaded a mean of 3.7 apps per month. Historical data suggest that the population standard deviation for Android users is 1 app per month, and the population standard deviation for iPhone users is 1.2 apps per month. Calculate and interpret the 95% confidence interval estimate for the difference in mean apps downloaded per month between Android and iPhone users. Assign population 1 to be iPhone users. Exercise 2: An HR manager would like to know how much the mean number of overtime hours differs between employees that have children at home and those who don’t have children at home. The manager takes a random sample of 35 employees with children at home and finds that these employees work a mean of 4.2 overtime hours and have a standard deviation of 4 hours. An independent random sample of 40 employees without children at home has a mean of 6.5 overtime hours and a standard deviation of 5.9 hours. Calculate and interpret a 99% confidence interval estimate for the difference in mean overtime hours between these two groups. Use employees with children at home as Population 1.

Be sure to calculate the appropriate degrees of freedom for the test you are performing. Interpreting the test: (Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the answer to that question. In other words, we must interpret the conclusion of our test in terms of the original question. Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given \\(\\alpha\\) level of significance you may conclude that \\(H_{A}\\) is true. If you do not reject \\(H_{0},\\ \\)then you must conclude that \\(H_{A}\\) is unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how to interpret hypothesis tests: always look at the alternative hypothesis! In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and says either that it is true or that we cannot conclude that it is true.

In order for us to be confident that our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If the assumptions are not met – that is, if any given assumption is not true – then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the wrong conclusions. When making inferences about a single population variance using \\(\\chi^{2}\\): The underlying population must be normally distributed. If it is not normal, then the sampling distribution is unknown, so we cannot use \\(\\chi^{2}\\)as the sampling distribution. The sample must be random.

The Test Statistic: To properly formulate the test statistic, you MUST use the larger sample variance as \\(s_{1}^{2}\\) and the smaller sample variance as \\(s_{2}^{2}\\). You can use this information to label the populations: the sample with the larger sample variance is sample 1 from Population 1, and the sample with the smaller variance is sample 2 from Population 2. By doing this, you will ensure that the test statistic is in the upper tail of the F distribution, and the critical values on the F table will work properly. For hypothesis testing about two population variances, the sample statistics of interest are the sample variances, \\(s_{1}^{2}\\text{\\ and\\ }s_{2}^{2}.\\) Under the assumption that \\(H_{0}\\) is true as an equality, the sampling distribution of the ratio of the sample variances follows the F distribution. Therefore, we standardize our samples against the F distribution by calculating the following F test statistic: \\[F_{\\text{test}} = \\ \\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\\ \\] \\[with\\ Numerator\\ degrees\\ of\\ freedom = df_{1} = \\ n_{1} - 1\\] \\[\\ and\\ Denominator\\ degrees\\ of\\ freedom = df_{2} = \\ n_{2} - 1\\] where \\[{s_{1}^{2} = the\\ sample\\ variance\\ of\\ sample\\ 1 }{s_{2}^{2} = the\\ sample\\ variance\\ of\\ sample\\ 2 }{n_{1} = the\\ sample\\ size\\ of\\ sample\\ 1 }{n_{2} = the\\ sample\\ size\\ of\\ sample\\ 2}\\] NOTE: some problems will give you the variances (\\(s_{1}^{2}\\text{\\ and\\ }s_{2}^{2})\\), in which case you simply plug the values into the equation as is. However, some problems will give you standard deviations (\\(s_{1}\\text{\\ and\\ }s_{2}),\\) in which case you would need to square those values in this equation. Deciding whether or not to Reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\): There are two approaches to deciding whether or not to reject the Null: In the p-value approach, we compare the p-value of our test statistic to the \\(\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\) significance level and reject \\(H_{0}\\) if the p-value is less than or equal to the \\(\\alpha\\) significance level. In the critical value approach, we compare the test statistic to a critical value – this can be done with a diagram in which we use the critical value(s) to construct a rejection region or regions; if the test statistic is in a rejection region, we reject \\(H_{0}\\) and accept \\(H_{A}.\\) Or, this step can be accomplished by following the mathematical rules given in the tables below. REMINDER: you can never accept the null hypothesis. Remember the swans.

We start every hypothesis test with a question about the parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the answer to that question. In other words, we must interpret the conclusion of our test in terms of the original question. Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given \\(\\alpha\\) level of significance you may conclude that \\(H_{A}\\) is true. If you do not reject \\(H_{0},\\ \\)then you must conclude that \\(H_{A}\\) is unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how to interpret hypothesis tests: always look at the alternative hypothesis! In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers from your hypothesis test for the symbols.

["multinomial-probability-distributions.html", "Multinomial Probability Distributions", " Multinomial Probability Distributions Goodness of Fit tests are hypothesis tests that determine whether or not a categorical variable has a particular probability distribution across its categories. Goodness-of-Fit tests employ the concept of a multinomial probability distribution, which is a probability distribution that gives the probabilities of three or more categorical outcomes. A multinomial probability distribution for k categorical outcomes is simply a list of probabilities, one per category of the variable, like this: \\[p_{1} = P_{1} = probability\\ of\\ an\\ outcome\\ being\\ in\\ category\\ 1\\] \\[p_{2} = P_{2} = probability\\ of\\ an\\ outcome\\ being\\ in\\ category\\ 2\\] \\[\\ldots\\] \\[p_k = P_k = probability\\ of\\ an\\ outcome\\ being\\ in\\ category\\ k\\] Category probabilities (\\(P_{1},P_{2},\\ldots,\\ P_{k}\\)) must always be between 0 and 1; that is, \\(0 \\leq P_{i} \\leq 1\\). Therefore, if probabilities are expressed as percentages in a problem, those percentages must be divided by 100 to get probabilities. In a properly formulated multinomial probability distribution, the sum of all of the category probabilities is 1. Example 1: Suppose you were studying a population of cats at an animal shelter. The variable you are interested in is color. The cats at the shelter come in three colors: tabby, black, and calico. 25% of the cats are tabby, 60% of the cats are black, and 15% of the cats are calico. Construct the multinomial probability distribution of color for this population. \\[i\\] Category Probability 1 Tabby 2 Black 3 Calico A multinomial probability distribution can be used to calculate expected frequencies. Expected frequencies are the number of outcomes per category that we expect to find in a sample drawn from a population with the given distribution. To calculate the expected frequencies for a sample of size \\(n\\), use the following equation: \\[e_{i} = n(P_{i})\\] where \\[e_i = the\\ expected\\ frequency\\ for\\ the\\ i^{th}\\ category \\\\ n = the\\ sample\\ size \\\\ P_i = the\\ probability\\ of\\ an\\ outcome\\ being\\ in\\ category\\ i\\] NOTE: Expected frequencies often come out with decimals. You should NOT round them to whole numbers. Keep them at four decimals unless they come out even to fewer decimal places. Example 2: Consider the multinomial probability distribution from Example 1. What are the expected frequencies for a random sample of size 50 drawn from this population? In other words, how many cats in the sample are expected to be tabby, how many black, and how many calico, theoretically? \\[i\\] Categoryi Probability \\[P_i\\] Expected Frequency \\[e_i\\] 1 Tabby 2 Black 3 Calico Example 3: a) A given variable has eight categories.

NOTE: \\(P_1,P_2,\\ldots,P_k\\ are\\ probabilities\\ between\\ 0\\ and\\ 1\\) \\(k = the\\ number\\ of\\ categories\\) The Test Statistic: Here is the idea behind Goodness of Fit tests: if the null hypothesis is true, then the multinomial probability distribution in \\(H_{0}\\ \\)truly describes the population. This means that the observed frequencies from the sample should be the same as (or very close to) the expected frequencies calculated from the \\(H_{0}\\ \\)probability distribution. (For example, if 25% of the population fits into Category A, then about 25% of the sample should fit into Category A.) Large differences between the observed frequencies and the expected frequencies are evidence that the underlying population is NOT distributed according to the hypothetical multinomial probability distribution. Some variation between observed and expected frequencies will occur due to random chance, so we need to use our hypothesis testing techniques to see if the differences we see are statistically significant. The \\(\\text{α\\ significance\\ level}\\) sets a threshold at which we determine the sample distribution to be different enough from what we would expect under the null hypothesis, to contradict the null hypothesis. The size of the difference between the observed and expected frequencies is quantified in our \\(\\chi^{2}\\ \\)test statistic. When the test statistic is large enough to reject the null, we can conclude that the population is not distributed according to the hypothetical multinomial probability distribution. The test statistic for a Goodness-of-Fit Test is: \\[\\chi_{test}^{2} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{k}\\frac{\\left(f_{i} - e_{i}\\right)^{2}}{e_{i}}\\] \\[where\\] \\[e_i = nP_i = the\\ expected\\ frequency\\ for\\ category\\ i \\\\ f_i = the\\ observed\\ sample\\ frequency\\ for\\ category\\ i \\\\ k = the\\ number\\ of\\ categories \\\\ n = sample\\ size\\] \\[and\\] \\[the\\ degrees\\ of\\ freedom\\ are\\ df = k - 1\\] Deciding whether or not to Reject \\(H_0\\): Only large discrepancies between the observed and expected frequencies constitute evidence against the null hypothesis, so all Goodness-of-Fit tests are upper tail tests.

Assumptions Underlying These Hypothesis Tests All hypothesis tests use sampling distributions to determine the probability of sample statistics. In order for us to be confident that our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If the assumptions are not met – that is, if any given assumption is not true – then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the wrong conclusions. For Goodness-of-Fit Tests, the only assumption that must be satisfied is that the expected frequency for each category must be greater than five: \\[e_{i} \\geq 5\\] Exercise: A bike shop sells bikes with frames made from four different materials: carbon fiber, aluminum, steel, and titanium.

Hypotheses for Tests of Independence \\(H_{0}:\\left\\lbrack Variable\\ 1 \\right\\rbrack\\ text{\\ is\\ independent\\ of\\ }\\left\\lbrack Variable\\ 2 \\right\\rbrack\\) \\(H_{A}:\\left\\lbrack Variable\\ 1 \\right\\rbrack\\text{ \\ is\\ not\\ independent\\ of\\ }\\left\\lbrack Variable\\ 2 \\right\\rbrack\\) Answers questions about: Whether or not \\[*Variable 1*\\] is related to \\[*Variable 2*\\] NOTE: \\[*Variable 1*\\] and \\[*Variable 2*\\] must both be categorical variables The Test Statistic: The logic is the similar to a Goodness of Fit test. The expected frequencies are the counts we expect to get for each joint category in the sample if the two variables are independent (that is, if the null hypothesis is true). Observed frequencies are the actual frequencies in the random sample. Some variation between observed and expected frequencies will occur due to random chance, so we use our hypothesis testing techniques and set a threshold (the \\(\\text{α\\ significance\\ level}\\)) at which we consider the differences between observed and expected counts to be large enough to contradict the null hypothesis. If the differences between the expected and observed frequencies are large, then the sample contradicts the null hypothesis and it is rejected, with the conclusion that \\(H_{A}\\) is true: the variables are not independent. The size of the difference between the observed and expected frequencies is quantified in our \\(\\chi^{2}\\ \\)test statistic, which is calculated according to this formula: \\[\\chi_{\\text{test}}^{2} = \\sum_{i}^{}{\\sum_{j}^{}\\frac{\\left( f_{\\text{ij}} - e_{\\text{ij}} \\right)^{2}}{e_{\\text{ij}}}}\\] where \\[{f_{\\text{ij}} = the\\ observed\\ frequencies\\ from\\ the\\ sample }{e_{\\text{ij}} = the\\ expected\\ frequencies\\ if\\ the\\ variables\\ are\\ independent}\\] \\[\\text{and}\\] \\[the\\ degrees\\ of\\ freedom\\ are\\ df = \\left( r - 1 \\right)\\left( c - 1 \\right)\\] where \\[r = the\\ number\\ of\\ categories\\ in\\ Variable\\ 1\\] \\[c = the\\ number\\ of\\ categories\\ in\\ Variable\\ 2\\] We will use a contingency table with \\(i\\) rows and \\(\\text{j\\ }\\)columns to begin our calculation of this test statistic. Deciding whether or not to Reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\): Only large differences between the observed and expected frequencies constitute evidence against the null hypothesis, so all Tests of Independence are upper tail tests. The two possible decisions are: \\(\\text{Reject\\ }H_{0}\\text{\\ and\\ accept\\ }H_{A}\\) \\(\\text{Do\\ not\\ reject\\ }H_{0}\\text{\\ and\\ conclude\\ that\\ }H_{A}\\text{\\ is\\ unsupported.}\\) REMINDER: you can never accept the null hypothesis. Remember the swans. When to Reject \\(\\mathbf {H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\mathbf{\\ }\\)in Tests of Independence: Always an Upper Tail Test: p-value approach: Calculate the upper tail \\(p\\text{-}\\text{value}\\) of \\(\\chi_{\\text{test}}^{2}\\) If the \\(p\\text{-}value \\leq \\ \\alpha,\\) then reject \\(H_{0}\\) and accept \\(H_{A}.\\) If the \\(p\\text{-}value &gt; \\alpha\\), then do not reject \\(H_{0}\\). \\(H_{A}\\) is unsupported. Critical Value: Approach Look up the UT Critical Value of \\(\\chi^{2}\\), which is \\(\\chi_{\\alpha,UT}^{2}\\) If \\(\\chi_{\\text{test}}^{2} \\ geq \\chi_{\\alpha,UT}^{2},\\ \\)then reject \\(H_{0}\\)and accept \\(H_{A}\\). If \\(\\chi_{\\text{tes t}}^{2} &lt; \\chi_{\\alpha,UT}^{2}\\), then do not reject \\(H_{0}\\text{.\\ }H_{A}\\) is unsupported. NOTES: \\(\\chi_{\\text{test}}^{2}\\ \\)is a Test Statistic \\(\\chi_{\\alpha,UT}^{2}\\) is a Critical Value \\(\\chi^{2}\\) is based on degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom in Tests of Independence is \\[d f = \\left( r - 1 \\right)\\left( c - 1 \\right)\\text{\\ where\\ r\\ is \\ the\\ number\\ of\\ categories}\\] \\[in\\ Variable \\ 1\\ and\\ c\\ is\\ the\\ number\\ of \\ categories\\ in\\ Variable\\ 2.\\] Interpreting the test: (Note: This explanation of interpretation holds for ALL hypothesis tests.) We start every hypothesis test with a question about the parameter of interest, so we must end every hypothesis test with the answer to that question. In other words, we must interpret the conclusion of our test in terms of the original question. Remember: in hypothesis testing you can never prove the null hypothesis. You can only prove the alternative hypothesis: when you reject the null and accept the alternative, then at your given \\(\\alpha\\) level of significance you may conclude that \\(H_{A}\\) is true. If you do not reject \\(H_{0},\\ \\)then you must conclude that \\(H_{A}\\) is unsupported by the evidence. This gives us a clear guideline for how to interpret hypothesis tests: always look to the alternative hypothesis! In all that follows, you would substitute the actual words and numbers from your hypothesis test for the symbols. Notice that each interpretation simply states the alternative hypothesis in words, and says either that it is true or that it is unsupported by the evidence. How to Interpret a Test of Independence: When you: Interpretation: Reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\) At the \\(\\text{α\\ }\\)significance level, we can conclude that \\[*Variable 1*\\] is not independent of \\[*Variable 2*\\]. \\[*Variable 1*\\] and \\[*Variable 2*\\] are related. Do not reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\) At the \\(\\text{α\\ }\\)significance level, we cannot conclude that \\[*Variable 1*\\] and \\[*Variable 2*\\] are related. NOTES: When \\(H_{0}\\ \\)is rejected, you can: look at the distribution of outcomes in the sample for information about the relationship between \\[*Variable 1*\\] and \\[*Variable 2*\\]. compare the expected frequencies to the observed frequencies to learn about how the two variables are related. Assumptions Underlying These Hypothesis Tests All hypothesis tests use sampling distributions to determine the probability of sample statistics. In order for us to be confident that our choice of sampling distribution for any given test really is the way the sample statistic is distributed, certain assumptions must be met. If the assumptions are not met – that is, if any given assumption is not true – then we cannot rely on the results of the hypothesis tests. They may mislead us, give us the wrong answers, and cause us to draw the wrong conclusions. For Tests of Independence, the only assumption that must be satisfied is that the expected frequency for each combination of categories must be greater than five: \\[e_{\\text{ij}} \\geq 5\\] Exercise. An analyst for a chain of coffee shops suspects that a customer’s drink choice is related to the time of day when the customer comes in. The three drink choices the analyst would like to consider are Hot Coffee, Iced Coffee, and Specialty Drinks. The analyst takes a random sample of 503 customers and then splits the customers into two groups: those who came in before 11am and those who came in after 11am. Of the customers who came in before 11am, 90 ordered Hot Coffee, 79 ordered Iced Coffee, and 72 ordered Specialty Drinks. Of the customers who came in after 11am, 67 ordered Hot Coffee, 74 ordered Iced Coffee, and 121 ordered Specialty Drinks. Conduct a Test of Independence to find out whether drink choice is related to time of visit at the α = .01 significance level. First, fill in the Observed Frequencies from the sample data, then calculate the Row and Column Totals. Second, calculate the expected frequency, \\(e_{\\text{ij}}\\), for each combination of categories: \\[e_{\\text{ij}} = \\ \\frac{(Row\\ i\\ Total)(Column\\ j\\ Total)}{n}\\] where i is the row number, j is the column number, and n is the sample size. Contingency Table: \\[\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathbf{\\text{ij}}}\\] Before 11am After 11am Row Total Hot Coffee Iced Coffee Specialty Drink Column Total NOTE: there are three categories of Drink Choice, so r = 3. There are two categories of Time of Day, so c = 2. You will need this information later to calculate degrees of freedom for the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) test statistic and critical value. Third, fill in the following table. The sum of the last column is the \\(\\chi_{\\text{test}}^{2}\\) test statistic: Drink Choice Time of Visit Observed Frequency Expected Frequency Difference Squared/Expected Frequency \\[\\text{ij}\\] \\[f_{\\text{ij}}\\] \\[e_{\\text{ij}}\\] \\[\\frac{{{(f}_{\\text{ij}} - \\ e_{\\text{ij}})}^{2}}{e_{\\text{ij}}}\\] 11 Hot Coffee Before 11am 12 Hot Coffee After 11am 21 Iced Coffee Before 11am 22 Iced Coffee After 11am 31 Specialty Drinks Before 11am 32 Specialty Drinks After 11am \\[\\chi_{\\text{test}}^{2} = \\sum_{i}^{}{\\sum_{j}^{}\\frac{{{(f}_{\\text{ij}} - \\ e_{\\text{ij}})}^{2}}{e_{\\text{ij}}}} = \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\] The \\(\\chi^{2}\\) test statistic and critical value for a test of independence has (r – 1)(c – 1) degrees of freedom (see note from previous page).

["experimental-design.html", "Experimental Design", " Experimental Design An experimental design is a plan and a process for gathering data in which the researcher controls, modifies, or manipulates at least one variable. The purpose of gathering data in any research design, including experimental design, is to test hypotheses. In a study with an experimental design, the researcher begins with an idea about cause and effect. The researcher wants to test whether a treatment causes a response. To do this, each treatment is applied to a different group, and the mean responses of the groups are measured and compared to each other. Terminology: A factor is an explanatory variable, also called an Independent Variable (IV). It is the variable that the researcher controls, modifies, or manipulates to see what happens. The treatments are different levels or categories of the factor. Experimental units are the objects or subjects whose response the researcher is measuring. Experimental units are assigned to treatment groups which are groups of experimental units receiving a particular treatment. A response variable is the Dependent Variable (DV). It is what the researcher expects to vary with different treatments. A response is a single measurement of the response variable for a given experimental unit. Random assignment is the process of randomly assigning experimental units to treatment groups, or randomly assigning treatments to experimental units. Random assignment makes the groups equivalent at the outset of the study…. so any changes you see in the groups after applying the treatments, can be attributed to the treatments themselves. Two types of experimental design: Fully randomized experimental design: The treatments are randomly assigned to the groups, or, equivalently, the groups are randomly assigned to the treatments. In either case, the treatments are randomly assigned by the researcher. This is the key component of a fully randomized experimental design. The researcher imposes changes or otherwise manipulates the treatments that the groups receive. Can prove cause and effect. This is because the process of randomly assigning treatment groups makes the groups equivalent at the outset. Everything other than the treatment that could affect the response is randomly distributed among the groups. Therefore, any difference in the mean response between treatment groups must be due to the treatment itself. In a fully randomized experimental design, it is appropriate to call the Independent Variable (the factor) the cause and the Dependent Variable (the response) the effect. This is because you can prove cause and effect with a fully randomized experiment. Nonrandomized experimental design: also called quasi-experimental design. The treatments are not randomly assigned by the researcher, but different groups still receive different treatments. Cannot prove cause and effect. Both experimental designs contrast with another type of study design: observational design. In observational designs, outcomes are observed and measured for different groups, but there is no assignment of treatments to different groups. Researchers using observational designs look at ongoing behavior – they do not impose any changes in any variables. These studies are useful to illuminate associations and relationships between variables but they cannot prove cause and effect. In order for observational studies to have validity, they must use random sampling from the population of interest. In both nonrandomized experimental design and observational design, there is no way to completely rule out the possibility that there are pre-existing differences between treatment groups that explain differing responses. This is why these types of studies do not prove cause and effect. Excercise: xperimental Design: Exercise A local grocery store would like to increase sales on produce. This grocery store tracks purchases at the customer level. The grocery store decided that an effective way to boost sales of produce might be to redesign the weekly ad that customers receive. In the current design (Weekly Ad A), produce is on an inside page, the pictures are small, and the emphasis is on price. In the second design (Weekly Ad B), the produce is featured on the front page, beautifully photographed in full color, and there are recipes that incorporate produce. In the third design (Weekly Ad C) is the same as Design B except that there are no recipes. The grocery store takes a random sample of customers. These customers are randomly assigned to receive one of the three Weekly Ad designs. The customers’ purchases are tracked and their weekly spending on produce is measured. 1) What is the factor in this experiment? 2) What are two other terms for factor? 3) What are the treatments? How many treatments are there? 4) How many groups of customers will there be in this experiment? 5) What is the response variable in this experiment? 6) What is another term for response variable? 7) What are the experimental units? 8) Give an example of a response in this study. 9) Is this a fully randomized experiment? How do you know? 10) Suppose that differences in Weekly Spending on Produce are observed among the groups after they receive the Ads. Can the researcher conclude that the Weekly Ad Design caused those differences? "],
["introduction-to-analysis-of-variance-anova.html", "Introduction to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)", " Introduction to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) ANOVA is a hypothesis testing procedure that allows us to test the equality of three or more population means in one hypothesis test. ANOVA is used to test whether the mean response differs between treatment groups in fully randomized and quasi-experimental designs. It is also used to test between-group differences in observational studies when the samples are random. Formulating the Hypotheses: There is only one general form of hypotheses for ANOVA. It is adapted to each particular ANOVA depending on how many groups there are in a particular analysis. NOTE: \\(k = the\\ number\\ of\\ groups\\) Hypotheses for Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) \\(H_{0}:\\mu_{1} = \\ \\mu_{2} = \\ldots = \\ \\mu_{k}\\) \\[H_{A}:Not\\ all\\ of\\ the\\ means\\ are\\ equal\\] Answers questions about: Whether at least one group has a different mean than the others. NOTE: \\(\\mu_{1} ,\\mu_{2},\\ldots,\\mu_{k}\\text{\\ are\\ the\\ means\\ of\\ the\\ dependent\\ }\\left( \\text{response} \\right)\\text{\\ variable\\ for\\ each\\ group.}\\) \\(k = the\\ number\\ of\\ groups\\) the alternative hypothesis may be stated as \\(H_{A}:At\\ least\\ two\\ of\\ the\\ population\\) \\(\\text{means\\ are\\ not\\ equal}\\). These two forms of \\(H_{A}\\) are equivalent to one another. The Test Statistic: In order to understand the test statistic, we need to know something about the process behind ANOVA. ANOVA estimates the variance of the dependent variable two different ways, and compares those variance estimates using an F test statistic. The two variance estimates are: The between-treatments estimate of the variance, also called the Mean Square due to Treatments (MSTR) The MSTR is the variance estimated under the assumption that \\(H_{0}\\ \\)is true The within-treatments estimate of the variance, also called the Mean Square due to Error (MSE) The MSE is the variance estimated under the assumption that \\(H_{0}\\ \\)is false The test statistic in ANOVA procedures is \\(F\\), and it is the ratio of the two variance estimates: the MSTR and the MSE. The by-hand calculation of this test statistic is the subject of its own handout. The equation is: \\[F_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{\\text{MSTR}}{\\text{MSE}}\\] with \\[{numerator\\ degrees\\ of\\ freedom = df_{1} = k - 1 }{denominator\\ degrees\\ of\\ freedom = df_{2} = n_{T} - k}\\] where \\[{k = the\\ number\\ of\\ groups }{n_{T} = total\\ sample\\ size\\ (of\\ all\\ the\\ groups)}\\] Deciding whether or not to Reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\): ANOVA \\(F\\) tests are always one-tailed, upper tail tests. The reason for this is due to the nature of the two variance estimates: the MSTR and the MSE. Here is how ANOVA works. If \\(H_{0}\\) is actually true and all the means of the groups are equal, then both the MSTR and the MSE will yield similar estimates of the true variance. Therefore, the ratio of MSTR and MSE (which is \\(F)\\ \\)will be a small number – too small to cause us to reject \\(H_{0}.\\) If, on the other hand, \\(H_{0}\\) is actually false, and the means of the groups are not all equal, the MSTR will vastly overestimate the true variance, while the MSE will estimate the true variance accurately. Therefore, the ratio of the MSTR and MSE (which is \\(F)\\ \\)will be a large number – large enough to cause us to reject \\(H_{0}.\\) We only want to reject the null when the difference between MSTR and MSE is large, hence the use of the upper tail test. When to Reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\) in ANOVA (the Test Statistic is \\(\\mathbf {F}_{\\mathbf{\\text{test}}}\\)) Always an Upper Tail Test: p-value approach: Calculate the upper tail \\(p\\text{-}\\text{value}\\) of \\(F_{\\text{test}}.\\) If the \\(\\text{UT\\ p}\\text{-}value \\leq \\ \\alpha,\\) then reject \\(H_{0}\\) and accept \\(H_{A}.\\) If the \\(\\tex t{UT\\ p}\\text{-}value &gt; \\alpha\\), then do not reject \\(H_{0}\\text{.\\ }H_{A}\\) is unsupported. Critical Value Approach: If \\(F_{\\tex t{test}} \\geq F_{\\alpha},\\ \\)then reject \\(H_{0}\\) and accept \\(H_{A}.\\) If \\(F_{\\text{test}} &lt; F_{\\alpha}\\), then do not reject \\(H_{0}\\text{.\\ }H_{A}\\) is unsupported. NOTES: \\(F_{\\text{test}}\\ \\)is the Test Statistic \\(F_{\\alpha}\\) is the upper tail Critical Value (from the \\(F\\) table). The \\(\\text{numerator\\ degrees\\ of\\ freedom} = k - 1\\), \\(\\text{denominator\\ de grees\\ of\\ freedom} = n_{T} - k\\) where \\[{k = the\\ number\\ of\\ groups }{n_{T} = total\\ sample\\ size\\ (of\\ all\\ the\\ groups)}\\] Interpreting the test: How to Interpret an ANOVA: When you: Interpretation: Reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\) At the \\(\\text{α\\ }\\)significance level, we can conclude that not all of the population means are equal. Could also be stated: At the \\(\\text{α\\ }\\)significance level, we can conclude that at least one of the populations has a different mean than the others. Do not reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\) At the \\(\\text{α\\ }\\)significance level, we cannot conclude that any of the population means are different from one another. NOTES: When \\(H_{0}\\ \\)is rejected, you can then perform comparisons of pairs of means from the ANOVA to determine which one is different (or which ones are different) Assumptions Underlying ANOVA Tests ANOVA relies on three assumptions: For each population, the response variable (dependent variable) is normally distributed. Each treatment group in an experiment represents a potentially different population, and in each population, the response variable, also called the dependent variable, must be normally distributed. This holds true for groups in observational studies as well. The variance of the response variable is the same for all of the populations. The observations must be independent. In experimental designs, this assumption is satisfied by the use of random assignment to place experimental units into treatment groups. In observational designs, this assumption is satisfied by using random sampling. "],
["calculating-the-anova-test-statistic-and-summary-table.html", "Calculating the ANOVA Test Statistic and Summary Table", " Calculating the ANOVA Test Statistic and Summary Table We calculate the F test statistic from the sample data. In ANOVA, this is no easy task. It involves a series of new equations and careful attention to detail. NOTE: A balanced design is one in which all the groups are the same size (all have the same \\(n\\)). An unbalanced design is one in which at least one group is a different size than the others. The book and MindTap use two different sets of equations for calculating the \\(F_{\\text{test}}\\) in ANOVA, and one set only works if you have a balanced design. The formulas in this handout will work properly no matter which design is being used, so I recommend you just stick with these. For the following equations: There are \\(k\\) treatment groups. Each group has a sample size, called \\(n_{j}\\) for the jth treatment group (e.g. the second treatment group has a sample size of \\(n_{2}\\)). Keep this notation in mind. The \\(\\mathbf{\\text{F\\ }}\\)test statistic has a numerator and a denominator that must be calculated separately. The numerator of the F test statistic is the MSTR: Recall: the MSTR is the Mean Square due to Treatments, also called the between-treatments estimate of the variance. This is the estimate of the true variance under the assumption that \\(H_{0}\\) is true, which would mean that all the group population means were equal.

["fishers-least-significant-difference-a-multiple-comparison-procedure.html", "Fisher’s Least Significant Difference: a Multiple Comparison Procedure", " Fisher’s Least Significant Difference: a Multiple Comparison Procedure If the null hypothesis in an ANOVA is rejected, then you may conclude that not all the population means are equal. However, ANOVA by itself cannot tell you which of the means are different. It could be only one group that has a different mean with the rest being equal, or two groups, or all of the groups could have different means. ANOVA is silent in that respect. Consider the case where there are four groups in an ANOVA analysis, so the null and alternative hypotheses are: \\(H_{0}:\\ \\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2} = \\mu_{3} = \\mu_{4}\\) \\(H_{A}:Not\\ all\\ the\\ population\\ means\\ are\\ equal\\) If the null is rejected, then the question becomes: which mean is not equal to the others? Are they all different, or is only one or two different from the others? This is where multiple comparison procedures come in. Multiple comparison procedures are only used after ANOVA confirms a difference, to find out which groups have a different mean from the others. Multiple comparison procedures test pairs of means, and you have to run one test per pair. Mathematically, we need to ask: \\(\\text{is\\ }\\mu_{1} \\neq \\mu_{2}?\\ \\text{is\\ }\\mu_{2} \\neq \\mu_{3}?\\ \\text{is\\ }\\mu_{3} \\neq \\mu_{4}?\\) is \\(\\mu_{1} \\neq \\mu_{3}?\\ \\text{is\\ }\\mu_{2} \\neq \\mu_{4}?\\text{is}\\ \\mu_{1} \\neq \\mu_{4}?\\ \\ \\)Notice how those questions look like alternative hypotheses in a two tailed test? Well, that is exactly what they are used for in multiple comparisons. Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (Fisher’s LSD) procedure is commonly used for multiple comparisons. Fisher’s LSD is a special type of two-tailed t test. There are three different methods to use Fisher’s LSD: a traditional t test; a modified t test; and, a confidence interval. All three methods will come to the same conclusion, because they are all different ways of using the same information. All three ways are presented in this handout and in 13.3 in the book, but in this class only METHOD 2 will be used on the homework and on exams.

If the null hypothesis is not rejected, then there is no evidence that \\(\\mu_{i}\\text{\\ and\\ }\\mu_{j}\\ \\)are different. Conduct one test for each possible pair of means from the ANOVA Method 2: Fisher’s LSD as a series of modified t tests: (This is the one we will use in this course) Take any two groups from the ANOVA (here they are labeled \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) just to differentiate them). Set an \\(\\alpha\\) significance level. The hypotheses are: \\(H_{0}:\\ \\mu_{i} = \\mu_{j}\\) \\(H_{A}:\\ \\mu_{i} \\neq \\mu_{j}\\) The test statistic is: \\({\\overline{x}}_{i}\\ - \\ {\\overline{x}}_{j}\\) \\(\\text{where}\\) \\({\\overline{x}}_{i} = the\\ sample\\ mean\\ of\\ group\\ i\\) \\({\\overline{x}}_{j} = the\\ sample\\ mean\\ of\\ group\\ j\\) The Least Significant Difference is: \\(LSD = t_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\text{MSE}\\left( \\frac{1}{n_{i}}\\ + \\ \\frac{1}{n_{j}} \\right)}\\text{\\ where\\ the\\ }2T\\ t_{\\alpha/2}\\text{\\ Critical\\ Value\\ has\\ }df_{2} = n_{T} - k\\) \\[\\text{and}\\] \\[{n_{i} = sample\\ size\\ of\\ the\\ i^{\\text{th}}\\text{\\ group} }{n_{j} = sample\\ size\\ of\\ the\\ j^{\\text{th}}\\text{\\ group} }{n_{T} = the\\ total\\ sample\\ size\\ from\\ the\\ ANOVA }{k = the\\ number\\ of\\ groups\\ in\\ the\\ ANOVA}\\] and the rejection rule is: \\(\\text{If\\ }\\left| {\\overline{x}}_{i}\\ - \\ {\\overline{x}}_{j} \\right| \\geq LSD\\ then\\ reject\\ H_{0}\\text{\\ and\\ accept\\ }H_{A}\\text{.\\ }\\) \\(\\text{If\\ }\\left| {\\overline{x}}_{i}\\ - \\ {\\overline{x}}_{j} \\right| &lt; LSD\\ then\\ \\text{do\\ not}\\text{\\ reject\\ }H_{0}\\text{\\ and\\ conclude\\ }H_{A}\\text{\\ is\\ unsupported.\\ \\ \\ }\\) If the null hypothesis is rejected, then the two group means \\(\\mu_{i}\\text{\\ and\\ }\\mu_{j}\\) are different. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, then there is no evidence that \\(\\mu_{i}\\text{\\ and\\ }\\mu_{j}\\) are different. Conduct one test for each possible pair of means from the ANOVA. Note that this method is very efficient to use for multiple comparisons in balanced designs (i.e. those in which the groups are all the same size). In balanced designs, you only have to compute the LSD once because it will be the same no matter which two groups you are testing. Then you can compute the difference between each pair of means and compare the absolute value of each difference to the LSD to see whether to reject the null. In unbalanced designs (i.e. those in which the groups are not all the same size), you will have to compute the LSD individually for each test. Method 3: Fisher’s LSD as a series of confidence intervals: Take any two groups from the ANOVA (here they are labeled \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) just to differentiate them). Set an α significance level. The hypotheses are: \\(H_{0}:\\ \\mu_{i} = \\mu_{j}\\) \\(H_{A}:\\ \\mu_{i} \\neq \\mu_{j}\\) Calculate a \\(100\\left( 1 - \\alpha \\right)\\%\\) confidence interval for the difference between \\(\\mu_{i}\\text{\\ and\\ }\\mu_{j}\\) using the following equation: \\({\\overline{x}}_{i}\\ - \\ {\\overline{x}}_{j}\\ \\pm LSD\\ where\\ \\) \\(LSD = t_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\sqrt{\\text{MSE}\\left( \\frac{1}{n_{i}}\\ + \\ \\frac{1}{n_{j}} \\right)}\\ \\ and\\ the\\ t\\ critical\\ value\\ has\\ df = n_{T} - k\\) The rejection rule is: \\(\\text{Reject\\ }H_{0}\\text{\\ if\\ the\\ confidence\\ interval\\ does\\ not\\ include\\ zero.}\\) If the null hypothesis is rejected, then the two group means \\(\\mu_{i}\\text{\\ and\\ }\\mu_{j}\\) are different. Conduct one test for each possible unique pair of means from the ANOVA Example. We are going to use Fisher’s LSD to test the groups from the Grocery Store Ad example on Ch 13: Handout #4. Part 1. Using Method 2, perform a Fisher’s LSD procedure to test whether the population mean produce spending for the group that received Ad A is different than Ad B.

["introduction-1.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Simple linear regression is a statistical procedure that models the relationship between two variables. The two variables are the dependent variable (DV) called y, and the independent variable (IV), called x. A statistical model is a simplified picture of the relationship between variables that emphasizes key features and regular patterns. In simple linear regression, we model the relationship between two variables as a straight line. Why do we build statistical models? It is to be able to explain what is going on with the dependent variable, and to make predictions about the future based on data in the past. For example, we can model the relationship between a person’s level of education (x) and salary (y) to predict how much money they will make – in fact we could use regression on this problem and predict how much more people will make for each additional year of education they have. We can model the durability of a painted coating (y) based on the thickness of the coating (x). How thick does the coating have to be to hit our durability target? Statistical modeling can help with that. Regression in particular is for modeling linear relationships. Other statistical models exist to model other kinds of relationships. The Regression Model is a straight line defined by the following equation: \\[y = \\ \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\ \\epsilon\\] where \\[{y = the\\ dependent\\ variable }{x = the\\ independent\\ variable }{\\beta_{0} = the\\ population\\ intercept }{\\beta_{1} = the\\ population\\ slope\\ on\\ x,the\\ coefficient\\ on\\ x\\ }{\\epsilon = random\\ error }\\] The regression model describes the relationship between x and y in the population – so \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) are population parameters. Since they are population parameters, they are not directly measured. Rather, we use sample data to estimate these population values, and draw conclusions about them using statistical inference, like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. In regression, a random sample is taken from a population, and the data in the sample is used to calculate a linear equation, called the Estimated Regression Equation (ERE): \\[\\widehat{y} = b_{0} + b_{1}x\\] \\[{\\text{where\\ }\\widehat{y} = the\\ expected\\ or\\ predicted\\ value\\ of\\ y\\ \\left( \\text{the\\ mean\\ of\\ y} \\right) }{b_{0} = the\\ sample\\ intercept;the\\ estimate\\ of\\ \\beta_{0} }{b_{1} = the\\ sample\\ slope;the\\ estimate\\ of\\ \\beta_{1}}\\] The Estimated Regression Equation gives us a way to calculate the expected value of y at a given value of x. The expected value of y at a given x is the long-run mean of y: the mean value of y at a given x if many samples were taken from the same population. To state this more formally, \\(\\widehat{y}\\) is a point estimate for E(y), the expected value of y at a given x. It is often called the predicted value of y. A Refresher on the Equation of a Line The equation of a line is: \\[y = b + mx\\] \\[{\\text{where\\ b} = the\\ intercept }{m = the\\ slope\\ of\\ the\\ line}\\] The slope of the line: \\(m = \\frac{\\text{change\\ in\\ y}}{\\text{change\\ in\\ x}}\\) When graphing a line, the vertical axis is the y axis, and the horizontal axis is the x axis. Hence, the slope is often described as \\(m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\) because it describes how much the line rises up the y axis as it runs along the x axis. Example 1: Refresher 1. Graph the following equation. What is the slope? Interpret the slope by stating in words how much y changes (and in what direction) for a one unit change in x. \\[y = 1 + 0.5x\\] Example 2: Refresher 2. Graph the following equation. What is the slope? Interpret the slope by stating in words how much y changes (and in what direction) for a one unit change in x. \\[y = 8 - 2x\\] Example 3: Refresher 3. Graph the following equation. What is the slope? Interpret the slope in this equation by stating in words how much y changes (and in what direction) for a one unit change in x. \\[y = 5\\] And now back to regression… Now, data do not typically fall exactly on a nice straight line when graphed. Real-world data looks more like a cloud of points. Linear regression can only be used in cases where there is a plausible straight-line relationship between x and y. If the relationship between x and y is not linear, then you have to use some other technique to model it. Scatterplots which graph each data point are an important tool to recognize the relationships in your data. Here is how data that would typically be modeled with regression might look. Can you visualize the line that could model this data? Would it have a positive or a negative slope? Figure 1. \\[CHART\\] Here is another example of data that could be modeled with linear regression. Can you visualize the line that could model this data? Would it have a positive or a negative slope? Figure 2. \\[CHART\\] What about this one? Figure 3. \\[CHART\\] Now let’s look at some examples of data you would NOT model with linear regression. Do you see the nonlinear pattern? Figure 4. \\[CHART\\] If you modeled the data in Figure 4 with linear regression, the regression procedure would give you a straight line with a positive slope. But that straight line would misrepresent the actual relationship, which would cause your predictions to be way off! You as the researcher are responsible for avoiding this mistake – no computer is going to tell you not to make it. (NOTE: there are ways to transform data like this so that it can be modeled – if you continue studying statistics, you will find out about those). For now, protect yourself against such errors by graphing scatterplots of your data. Figure 5. \\[CHART\\] This is a dangerous pattern, because regression would model this as a horizontal line, or something close to that. And a horizontal line (which means the slope is zero) indicates there is no relationship between x and y. But there clearly is a relationship here – it is just not a linear relationship. Let’s look at some examples: \\[y = \\ \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\ \\epsilon\\] The estimated regression equation (ERE) is the relationship between x and y in the sample: \\[\\widehat{y} = b_{0} + b_{1}x\\] Remember, \\(\\widehat{y}\\) is the average \\(y\\) for a given \\(x\\), and is called the expected or predicted value of \\(y\\). Example 4. Regression could be used to investigate the relationship between weekly sales and weekly advertising. To use regression to model this relationship, first designate the DV and the IV. \\[{y = Weekly\\ Sales\\ \\left( \\$ \\right) }{x = Weekly\\ Advertising\\ \\left( \\$ \\right)}\\] Then take a random sample of weeks and measure sales and advertising in the prior week for each. The graph of the data looks like this. Do you expect a positive or a negative slope on the regression line?: \\[CHART\\] The sample data is used to calculate the following values: \\[{Intercept:\\ b}_{0} = 267.30\\] \\[Slope:b_{1} = 4.51\\] \\[95\\%\\ confidence\\ interval\\ for\\ the\\ population\\ slope,\\ \\beta_{1} = \\lbrack 3.35,\\ 5.66\\rbrack\\] a) Write down the Estimated Regression Equation (ERE). b) If $235 is spent on advertising, what would be the predicted sales? Interpret this value. c) What is the interpretation of the slope, \\(b_{1}?\\) d) Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the population slope, \\(\\beta_{1}\\) Example 5. The owners of a restaurant think that as the temperature of a certain drink increases, customer satisfaction will decrease. A random sample of customers who order this drink is taken, and the temperature of the drink along with the customer satisfaction rating (0 to 100) is measured. To use regression to model this relationship, first we designate the DV and the IV. \\[{y = Customer\\ Satisfaction\\ Rating }{x = Temperature\\ (℉)}\\] Here is the scatterplot of the data collected:\\[CHART\\] The sample data is used to calculate the following values: \\[{{Intercept:\\ b}_{0} = 105.2 }{{Slope:\\ b}_{1} = \\ - 1.42}\\] \\[95\\%\\ confidence\\ interval\\ for\\ the\\ population\\ slope,\\ \\beta_{1} = \\lbrack - 1.74,\\ - 1.09\\rbrack\\] a) Write down the Estimated Regression Equation (ERE) b) If the drink is served at \\(22℉\\), what would be the predicted customer satisfaction score?

["simple-linear-regression-what-it-all-means.html", "Simple Linear Regression: What it all means", " Simple Linear Regression: What it all means Simple linear regression is a statistical modeling procedure that models the relationship between one Dependent Variable (DV), \\(y,\\) and one Independent Variable (IV), \\(\\text{x.}\\) A model is a simplified representation that captures important characteristics but leaves out many details. The model of the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)in linear regression is a straight line. The linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the whole population of interest is represented in the Regression Model: \\[y = \\ \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\ \\epsilon\\] where \\[{y = the\\ dependent\\ variable }{x = the\\ independent\\ variable }{\\beta_{0} = the\\ population\\ intercept,\\ called\\ beta\\ nought\\ or\\ beta\\ zero }{\\beta_{1} = the\\ slope\\ on\\ x,the\\ coefficient\\ on\\ x,\\ called\\ beta\\ one }{\\epsilon = random\\ error }\\] The betas are population parameters, and as such, we cannot observe them directly. Instead, we take a random sample from the population and use the data from the sample to estimate the betas. That is what the regression procedure does: it analyzes all the data in the sample and uses it to calculate the Estimated Regression Equation: \\[\\widehat{y} = b_{0} + b_{1}x\\] \\[{\\text{where\\ }\\widehat{y} = the\\ expected\\ or\\ predicted\\ value\\ of\\ y\\ (the\\ mean\\ of\\ y)\\ }{b_{0} = the\\ sample\\ intercept;the\\ estimate\\ of\\ \\beta_{0} }{b_{1} = the\\ sample\\ slope;the\\ estimate\\ of\\ \\beta_{1}}\\] Regression output contains many different quantities, all of which are calculated from the data: that is, from the individual values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the observations in the data set. The data set will look like this, although the columns do not have to be in this order: Observation (\\(\\mathbf{i}\\)) Dependent Variable (\\(\\mathbf{y }_{\\mathbf{i}}\\)) Independent Variable (\\(\\mathbf{x }_{\\mathbf{i}}\\)) 1 \\[y_{1}\\] \\[x_{1}\\] 2 \\[y_{2}\\] \\[x_{2}\\] … … … \\[n\\] \\[y_{n}\\] \\[x_{n}\\] The Observation column – which may be labeled by Case or Subject, or whatever is appropriate for the study – is a unique identifier for each observation in the dataset. Every observation in the dataset consists of measurements for each variable. For example, if this dataset was for a regression investigating income and years of education, each observation would be an individual person (\\(i\\)), and for each person, income (\\(y_{i}\\)) and years of education (\\(x_{i}\\)) would be measured and recorded. From the values of \\(y_{i}\\) and \\(x_{i}\\) for each observation \\(i\\), we can calculate all of the values in the regression output. Linear regression calculates the estimated regression equation by employing something called the Least Squares Criterion, which minimizes the squared vertical distance between each observed value of \\(y\\) in the sample (each \\(y_{i}\\)) and the predicted \\(y\\) from the estimated regression equation (each \\({\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\)) at every value of \\(x_{i}\\). This vertical distance between observed and predicted (\\(y_{i} - {\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\)) is a very important quantity in regression, called the Residual. Mathematically, the Least Squares Criterion is stated: \\[Least\\ Squares\\ Criterion = min\\sum_{}^{}\\left( y_{i} - {\\widehat{y}}_{i} \\right)^{2}\\] So, the Least Squares Criterion minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. Conceptually, the estimated regression equation that linear regression calculates is the line that is as close as possible to all the points in the data set at once: that is what it means to satisfy the Least Squares Criterion. For linear regression with more than one independent variable, matrix algebra or calculus is required to calculate the estimated regression equation. The equations simplify in the case of Simple Linear Regression, and so we could easily calculate the equation, and in fact all the regression output, by hand – if we only had the time. For now, let’s concentrate on learning what the numbers in the regression output mean. Interpreting Linear Regression Output NOTE: in many of the interpretations, I refer to the DV as \\(y\\) and the IVs as \\(x,\\ x_{1},\\ x_{2}\\ \\)etc. When actually interpreting a regression, these variables have meaning and the meaning should be substituted in for these placeholder variables. In the Regression Statistics table (in order of importance/informativeness): The Coefficient of Determination, \\(\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{,\\ }\\)(called R Square in Excel) gives the proportion of the variability in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable or variables. \\(R^{2}\\) varies from 0 to 1, and when interpreted, it is converted to a percentage. In Simple Linear Regression: \\(R^{2}\\) measures the proportion of the variability in \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)that is explained by \\(x\\). Example: If \\(R^{2} = 0.7231,\\) then the interpretation is: 72.31% of the variability in \\(y\\) is explained by \\(\\text{x.}\\) In Multiple Regression: \\(R^{2}\\) measures the proportion of the variability in \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)that is explained by all of the independent variables, \\(x_{1},\\ x_{2},\\ \\ldots,\\ x_{p}\\). Example: If \\(R^{2} = 0.4979,\\) then the interpretation is: 49.79% of the variability in \\(y\\) is explained by \\(x_{1},\\ x_{2},\\ldots,\\ x_{p}.\\) The Standard Error of the Estimate, s, often called the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), measures the accuracy of the predictions made by the Estimated Regression Equation. It is the average distance that the observed \\(y\\) values in the sample fall from the regression line. Interpretation: the average error we would make using the estimated regression equation to predict \\(y\\). In other words: if we used the estimated regression equation to predict \\(y\\), we would be off by s on average. Example: If \\(s = 4\\ units,\\) then the interpretation is: \\(4\\ units\\) is the average error we would make if we used the estimated regression equation to predict \\(\\text{y.}\\) Another way to state the same thing is: If we used the estimated regression equation to predict y, we would be off by 4 units on average. The Standard Error of the Estimate is in the same units as \\(y\\), which makes it very easy to understand and interpret. The lower the Standard Error of the Estimate, the more accurate the predictions, so the lower the better! Given two regression models that predict the same DV measured in the same units, the Standard Error of the Estimate can be used to choose between models: whichever one has the lower Standard Error of the Estimate is the better model, because the predictions made with it will be more accurate. Adjusted \\(\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{\\ (notated\\ }\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{A}}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{)}\\) is used as a model comparison statistic in multiple regression. When comparing two models that predict the same DV in the same units, the one with the higher Adjusted \\(\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\) is the better model. NOTE: it is not appropriate to use regular old \\(R^{2}\\) to compare two models, because adding another IV to a regression model will increase \\(R^{2}\\), whether that IV explains anything or not. Adjusted \\(\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\), on the other hand, will only increase if the additional IV adds explanatory power, and will actually decrease if it does not. The Correlation Coefficient (called Multiple R in Excel) is denoted \\(R_{\\text{xy}}\\) in simple linear regression and \\(R_{ŷy}\\) in multiple regression. It gives a descriptive measure of the strength of the linear association between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) (in simple linear regression) and between \\(y\\) and all the \\(x\\text{&#39;}s\\) in multiple regression. The closer to 1, the stronger the association. Values close to 0 indicate that x and y are not linearly related. No rules are set in stone about what constitutes a “strong” or “weak” relationship. A common rule of thumb: &lt; 0.25: weak linear association; between 0.25 and 0.75: moderate linear association; &gt; 0.75: strong linear association The ANOVA table: recall: the sample data is our best representation of the underlying population, so if our model is good at predicting the sample values, we can infer it will also be good at predicting population values The ANOVA table in the regression output compares two different methods of predicting the sample data in an effort to help us decide if our regression model is any good. Premise: there are two alternative models you could use to predict \\(y\\). One model includes information about \\(x\\) and one does not: First, you could use the Estimated Regression Equation to predict \\(y\\) (in other words, predict \\({\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\) \\(\\ \\)at each \\(x_{i}\\)) Second, you could use the next best option, which is to just use \\(\\overline{y}\\) to predict \\(y\\) (in other words, predict \\(\\overline{y}\\) (the mean of y) at each \\(x_{i}\\)) This is also called the ‘Intercept only model’ because the equation of \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)does not include any \\(x\\) variables, thus being only an intercept, and representing a horizontal line at \\(y = \\ \\overline{y}\\). In the ANOVA table, you calculate the total errors you would make if you predicted the actual observed data using each of these models, square those errors, and sum them. In this way, we can compare the two possible models and decide whether our regression model is worth using. The Sum of Squares due to Error, \\(\\mathbf{\\text{SSE}},\\ \\)sometimes called the Residual Sum of Squares, is the total amount of prediction error we would make using the estimated regression equation to predict the observed sample data. It is the sum of the squared residuals. A residual is the difference between the observed and predicted \\(\\mathbf{y}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\) at a given \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\text{.\\ }\\)In other words: \\[\\mathbf{\\text{At\\ any\\ given\\ }}\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\mathbf{,\\ the\\ residual =}\\mathbf{y}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\mathbf{-}{\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\] The \\(SSE = \\sum_{}^{}\\left( y_{i} - {\\widehat{y}}_{i} \\right)^{2}\\), and has degrees of freedom \\(df_{2} = n - p - 1\\) Note: the sum of the squared residuals is the quantity that is minimized by the Least Squares Criterion! The Total Sum of Squares, \\(\\mathbf{SST,}\\ \\)is the total amount of prediction error we would make if we used \\(\\overline{y}\\) (the mean of \\(y_{i}\\)) to predict the observed sample data. The \\(SST = \\sum_{}^{}\\left( y_{i} - \\overline{y} \\right)^{2}\\), and has degrees of freedom \\(df = n - 1\\) The Sum of Squares due to Regression, \\(\\mathbf{SSR,}\\) is how much we will reduce prediction error by using the Estimated Regression Equation instead of the mean to predict the observed sample data. The \\(SSR = \\sum_{}^{}\\left( {\\widehat{y}}_{i} - \\overline{y} \\right)^{2}\\), and has degrees of freedom \\(df_{1} = p\\) The Mean Square Error, \\(\\mathbf{MSE,}\\) is the estimate of the variance of \\(\\epsilon\\). Remember \\(\\epsilon?\\) It is the random error term in the Regression Model: \\(y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\epsilon\\) The \\(MSE = \\frac{\\text{SSE}}{n - p - 1}\\) The Coefficients table: The \\(\\mathbf{\\text{sample\\ slope\\ coefficients}}\\), \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{,\\ }\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{,\\ldots,\\ }\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{p}}\\) , quantify the magnitude and direction of the relationship between each IV and the DV. They are point estimates, respectively, of \\(\\beta_{1},\\ \\beta_{2},\\ldots,\\ \\beta_{p}.\\) In Simple Linear Regression, the interpretation of \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\) is: If \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{&gt; 0}:\\) For every one unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)is predicted to increase by \\(b_{1}\\) on average. If \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{&lt; 0}:\\) For every one unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)is predicted to decrease by \\(b_{1}\\) on average. In Multiple Regression, each slope is interpreted. The interpretation for \\(b_{1}\\) is given here, and the interpretation of the other slopes follows the same pattern. The interpretation of \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\) is: If \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{&gt; 0}:\\) For every one unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)is predicted to increase by \\(b_{1}\\) on average, holding all other independent variables constant. If \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{&lt; 0}:\\) For every one unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)is predicted to decrease by \\(b_{1}\\) on average, holding all other independent variables constant. The \\(\\mathbf{sample\\ intercept,\\ }\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{0}},\\) is the value of \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)when \\(x = 0.\\) This is not always interpretable in the context of a given regression. Interpretability depends on whether the value \\(x = 0\\ \\)has substantive meaning. The \\(\\mathbf{\\text{confidence\\ intervals\\ for\\ the\\ slope\\ coefficients}}\\), \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{,\\ }\\mathbf{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{,\\ \\ldots,\\ }\\mathbf{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{p}}\\), and the \\(\\mathbf{intercept,\\ }\\mathbf{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\mathbf{,}\\) are based on the \\(\\alpha\\) significance level and are interpreted similarly to the other confidence intervals we have encountered: For a given slope coefficient, say \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{,}\\) the interpretation is: We can be \\(\\_\\_\\_\\%\\ \\)confident that the true value of the population slope coefficient for \\(x_{1}\\) is between \\[lower bound\\] and \\[upper bound\\]. For the intercept, \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\), the interpretation is: We can be \\(\\_\\_\\_\\%\\ \\)confident that the true value of the population intercept is between \\[lower bound\\] and \\[upper bound\\].

["simple-linear-regression-an-example.html", "Simple Linear Regression: An Example", " Simple Linear Regression: An Example We begin with a research question defining what we are investigating with regression: Does the time students spend on MindTap help explain (that is to say, predict) their grades? We will use an \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) significance level for this regression analysis. This question defines our variables and the relationship that we are investigating. Here the variables are: Dependent variable: \\(y = Overall\\ MindTap\\ Score\\ (\\%\\ points)\\) Independent variable: \\(x = Time\\ spent\\ logged\\ on\\ (hrs)\\) The dataset collected is a random sample of \\(n = 24\\) students enrolled in BA 3400. For each student, time spent logged on to MindTap (in hours) and overall MindTap score (in points) was recorded. Here is the dataset: Student # Hours Score 1 20.85 88.80 2 10.65 85.40 3 25.72 99.60 4 7.75 68.10 5 18.28 78.40 6 11.62 75.10 7 17.30 78.50 8 15.03 84.30 9 9.60 77.20 10 10.93 90.40 11 14.02 82.20 12 15.25 91.10 13 17.72 98.50 14 9.57 71.90 15 14.60 86.00 16 16.45 85.60 17 6.77 63.00 18 12.07 85.90 19 13.00 83.20 20 22.00 97.30 21 4.92 81.80 22 14.67 86.10 23 22.00 87.00 24 24.90 90.50 After the data collection step, the next thing to do is to graph a scatterplot of Scores vs Time Spent. In the scatterplot, we are chiefly concerned with non-linear patterns – if we see those, then we cannot use linear regression to analyze this data. We may also be able to identify a trend in the data that will give us an idea about the relationship between these two variables. Here is the scatterplot: \\[CHART\\] Do you see any nonlinear patterns? Do you see a trend in the data? What sign do you expect on the slope of the regression line? At this point, we can run the regression in Excel (Demo). See the next page for the results!

Then write the Estimated Regression Equation (Remember, the ERE is \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}\\mathbf{=}\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\mathbf{+}\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{x}\\)): Before we can use this equation for prediction or interpret the slope, we must confirm that there is a statistically significant relationship between MindTap Score (y) and Time Spent (x) in the population. (Remember, if the slope of a line is zero, then there is no relationship between x and y. If the slope of a line is a number other than zero, then there is a relationship between x and y.) Here is the Coefficients Table again: Coefficients Standard Error t Stat P-value Lower 95% Upper 95% Lower 99.0% Upper 99.0% Intercept 67.4709 3.9186 17.2182 2.97E-14 59.3443 75.5976 56.4254 78.5165 Hours 1.1151 0.2482 4.4927 0.0002 0.6004 1.6299 0.4155 1.8148 The sample slope \\(b_{1}\\) is 1.1151 which is definitely not zero… so that means there is a relationship between Hours and Score, right? Not necessarily! That sample slope just reflects what is going on in this sample of 24 students. We have to use this sample slope to prove that the population slope \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\) is not zero. If proven, then that would mean there is a statistically significant relationship between Hours and Score in the whole population of BA 3400 students, not just in these 24 students that were in the sample. That is what we need to prove before using the regression to explain or predict anything. Perform the hypothesis test detailed in Ch 14: Handout #2 to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between Hours and Score in the population: Now that we have confirmed that Hours and Score are related in the population, we can use our Estimated Regression Equation (ERE) to predict student scores, and we can interpret the slope \\(b_{1}.\\) First, let’s write down the ERE again: If 11 hours are spent on MindTap, what is the predicted score? Interpret this value. Interpret the slope \\(b_{1}.\\) Report and interpret the confidence interval for the population slope \\(\\beta_{1}.\\) Since we are doing this regression at the \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) significance level, which is a 99% confidence level, we should report and interpret the 99% confidence interval: But there is more to regression than that… The existence of a significant relationship between y and x is a necessary step – after all, if you cannot confirm a relationship between the IV and the DV, then the regression is no good for anything – but it is not sufficient to stop there. We need a way to judge the quality of the model. How well does it fit the data? Does it make accurate predictions? How much of the variation in y does x explain? Such questions are answered in the Regression Statistics table. But to understand the Regression Statistics table, we need to understand how the regression line (the estimated model) is calculated. Linear regression calculates the estimated regression equation which minimizes the squared vertical distance between each observed value of \\(y\\) in the sample (each \\(y_{i}\\)) and the regression line, at every value of \\(x_{i}\\) in the dataset. This vertical distance between observed and predicted y is a very important quantity in regression, called the Residual and it is calculated by taking the difference between the observed and predicted values of y for a given observation: \\[\\text{At\\ a\\ given\\ value\\ of\\ }x_{i},\\ the\\mathbf{\\ residual =}\\mathbf{y}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\mathbf{-}{\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\] Mathematically speaking, the regression line satisfies the Least Squares Criterion, which is: \\[Least\\ Squares\\ Criterion = min\\sum_{}^{}\\left( y_{i} - {\\widehat{y}}_{i} \\right)^{2}\\] So, the regression procedure minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. Conceptually, the estimated regression equation that linear regression calculates is the line that is as close as possible to all the points in the data set at once: that is what it means to satisfy the Least Squares Criterion. The regression line that satisfies the Least Squares Criterion is called the best-fit line. Let’s calculate some residuals for the MindTap data, to gain insight into what regression is doing and thereby understand what the output tells us. Here is part of the MindTap dataset, along with the graph of the data with the regression line: Student # Hours \\[(x_{i})\\] Score \\[(y_{i})\\] 1 20.85 88.80 2 10.65 85.40 3 25.72 99.60 4 7.75 68.10 5 18.28 78.40 … … … \\[CHART\\] Find Student #4 on the graph. Calculate the residual for this student. Find Student #3 on the graph. Calculate the residual for this student. The regression procedure uses the residuals for all 24 students in its placement of the regression line. It takes all the residuals into account at once, squares them (why?), sums them, and places the line where that sum is the smallest it can be. This sum of the squared residuals is extremely important, then! And that is why it is reported in the ANOVA table in the regression output. It is called the Sum of Squares due to Error or the Residual Sum of Squares, and it is notated as the SSE. \\[\\mathbf{\\text{SSE}} = \\sum_{}^{}\\left( y_{i} - {\\widehat{y}}_{i} \\right)^{2}\\] \\[\\text{with\\ d}f_{2} = n - p - 1\\] Let’s take a look at the ANOVA table from the MindTap regression output. (Refer to the Regression Output Equations Roadmap throughout). Where is the SSE and its degrees of freedom? ANOVA df SS MS F Significance F Regression 1 884.5979 884.5979 20.1839 0.0002 Residual 22 964.1917 43.8269 Total 23 1848.79 The other values in the ANOVA table are also important in what we are building towards – that is, assessing the quality of this model. The Total Sum of Squares, \\(\\mathbf{SST,}\\ \\)is the total amount of prediction error we would make if we used \\(\\overline{y}\\) (the mean of \\(y_{i}\\)) to predict the observed sample data. Where is the SST and its df in the ANOVA table? The \\(SST = \\sum_{}^{}\\left( y_{i} - \\overline{y} \\right)^{2}\\), and has degrees of freedom \\(df = n - 1\\) The Sum of Squares due to Regression, \\(\\mathbf{SSR,}\\) is how much we will reduce prediction error by using the Estimated Regression Equation instead of the mean to predict the observed sample data. Where is the SSR and its df in the ANOVA table? The \\(SSR = \\sum_{}^{}\\left( {\\widehat{y}}_{i} - \\overline{y} \\right)^{2}\\), and has degrees of freedom \\(df_{1} = p\\) The Mean Square Error, \\(\\mathbf{MSE,}\\) is the estimate of the variance of \\(\\epsilon\\). Remember \\(\\epsilon?\\) It is the random error term in the Regression Model: \\(y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\epsilon\\). Where is the MSE in the ANOVA table? The \\(MSE = \\frac{\\text{SSE}}{n - p - 1}\\) Putting this all together to explain the ANOVA table in regression: recall: the sample data is our best representation of the underlying population, so if our model is good at predicting the sample values, we can infer it will also be good at predicting population values The ANOVA table in the regression output compares two different methods of predicting the sample data in an effort to help us assess the quality of our regression model. We assess the regression by comparing its predictions to the next best alternative Premise: there are two different models you could use to predict \\(y\\). One model includes information about \\(x\\) and one does not: First, you could use the Estimated Regression Equation to predict \\(y\\) (in other words, predict \\({\\widehat{y}}_{i}\\) \\(\\ \\)at each \\(x_{i}\\)) Second, you could use the next best option, which is to just use the mean of \\(\\overline{y}\\) to predict \\(y\\) at each \\(x_{i}\\) This is also called the ‘Intercept only model’ because the equation of \\(\\text{y\\ }\\)does not include any \\(x\\) variables, thus being only an intercept, and representing a horizontal line at \\(y = \\ \\overline{y}\\). The ANOVA table reports the total errors made when predicting the actual observed data using each of these models. In this way, we can compare the two possible models and decide whether our regression model is worth using. So now that we have more understanding of what is in the ANOVA table, we should not be surprised to see all of these values showing up in the Regression Statistics table in the output, which contains the model fit stats we need.

["multiple-regression.html", "Multiple Regression", " Multiple Regression Multiple regression models the relationship between one dependent variable, \\(y\\), and two or more independent variables (IVs), which we will notate \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ x_{3},\\ldots,\\ x_{p}.\\) (Note: here the subscripts on the \\(x\\)’s signify different independent variables, not individual observations of\\(\\text{\\ x}\\).) So, multiple regression is linear regression with more than one independent variable. Everything we have learned in Simple Linear Regression applies to Multiple Regression as well, because Simple Linear Regression is just the special case of multiple regression in which there is only one \\(x\\). The Regression Model describes the relationship between the DV and the IVs in the population, and it is given by the following equation: \\[y = \\ \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\ \\beta_{2}x_{2} + \\ldots + \\ \\beta_{p}x_{p} + \\ \\epsilon\\] where \\[{y = the\\ dependent\\ variable }{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,\\ x_{p} = the\\ independent\\ variables }{\\beta_{0} = the\\ population\\ intercept }{\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\ldots\\ ,\\ \\beta_{p} = the\\ population\\ slopes,which\\ are\\ the\\ coefficients\\ on\\ the\\ x\\text{&#39;}\\text{s\\ } }{\\epsilon = random\\ error }{p = the\\ number\\ of\\ independent\\ variables}\\] The betas, (\\(\\beta_{0},\\beta_{1},\\ \\beta_{2},\\ \\ldots,\\ \\beta_{p}\\)), are population parameters. In other words, they are characteristics of the population as a whole, and so we cannot know their values without observing the entire population. When using regression, we take a random sample from the population of interest and we use that sample to estimate these parameters (the betas). That process results in the estimated regression equation (ERE): \\[\\widehat{y} = \\ b_{0} + \\ b_{1}x_{1} + \\ b_{2}x_{2} + \\ldots + \\ b_{p}x_{p}\\] where \\[{\\widehat{y} = the\\ expected\\ or\\ predicted\\ value\\ of\\ y\\ (the\\ mean\\ of\\ y) }{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,\\ x_{p} = the\\ independent\\ variables }{b_{0} = the\\ sample\\ intercept;the\\ estimate\\ of\\ \\beta_{0} }{b_{1},\\ b_{2},\\ldots,b_{p} = the\\ sample\\ slopes,which\\ are\\ the\\ coefficients\\ on\\ the\\ x^{&#39;}s;\\ }\\] \\[{\\text{the\\ }b^{&#39;}\\text{s\\ are\\ the\\ estimates\\ of\\ }\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\ldots,\\ \\beta_{p} }{p = the\\ number\\ of\\ independent\\ variables}\\] Multiple regression is based on the idea that the relationship between \\(y\\) and each \\(x\\) is linear, so you still must examine the scatterplot of \\(y\\) against each \\(x\\) to check for non-linear patterns. If you see non-linear patterns, you cannot use linear regression to model the relationship without modifying the variables to make the relationship linear (techniques for this exist, but are beyond the scope of this class). The equations to calculate the coefficients in multiple regression require calculus or matrix algebra, so we will not be calculating these by hand. Instead, we will use Excel to produce output for multiple regression and interpret that output. See Chapter 14: Handout #3 – Interpreting Linear Regression Output which includes interpretations for Multiple Regression as well as Simple Linear Regression. "],

In Chapter 14: Handout #2, we learned that we can use a two-tailed \\(t\\) test to confirm whether the population slope is different from zero. In multiple regression, we use that same procedure on each slope coefficient in turn. So, to confirm whether there is a relationship between \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(y\\), the hypotheses would be: \\[H_{0}:\\ \\beta_{1} = 0\\] \\[H_{A}:\\ \\beta_{1} \\neq 0\\] If \\(H_{0}\\) is rejected and \\(H_{A}\\) is accepted, then there is a relationship between \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(\\text{y.}\\) In other words, the relationship between \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(y\\) is statistically significant. Then, to confirm whether there is a relationship between \\(x_{2}\\) and \\(y\\), the hypotheses would be: \\[H_{0}:\\ \\beta_{2} = 0\\] \\[H_{A}:\\ \\beta_{2} \\neq 0\\] If \\(H_{0}\\) is rejected and \\(H_{A}\\) is accepted, then there is a relationship between \\(x_{2}\\) and \\(\\text{y.}\\) In other words, the relationship between \\(x_{2}\\) and \\(y\\) is statistically significant. . . . Finally, to confirm whether there is a relationship between \\(x_{p}\\) and \\(y\\), the hypotheses would be: \\[H_{0}:\\ \\beta_{p} = 0\\] \\[H_{A}:\\ \\beta_{p} \\neq 0\\] If \\(H_{0}\\) is rejected and \\(H_{A}\\) is accepted, then there is a relationship between \\(x_{p}\\) and \\(\\text{y.}\\) In other words, the relationship between \\(x_{p}\\) and \\(y\\) is statistically significant. Each slope coefficient must be tested separately. Luckily for us, Excel calculates the \\(t_{\\text{test}}\\) test statistic and two-tailed p-value for each slope coefficient and reports them in the regression output. We just need to compare the p-value to \\(\\alpha\\) in each case. If the p-value \\(\\leq \\ \\alpha\\), then we reject \\(H_{0}\\) and conclude there is a statistically significant relationship between the particular \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Remember: when the null hypothesis is rejected in these hypothesis tests, the conclusion is that the relationship between the given \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is statistically significant. Hypothesis Test for the Overall Significance of the Regression Model The \\(F\\) test reported in the ANOVA table in the regression output tests the overall significance of the regression model. It tests whether the model considered as a whole is significant. Whereas the \\(t\\) tests discussed above test for the significance of the relationship between each individual \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) separately, the \\(F\\) test shows whether \\(y\\) is related to the \\(\\text{set\\ of\\ all\\ }x^{&#39;}s\\), considered together. Technically speaking, the \\(F\\) test compares two different models for predicting \\(y:\\) the regression model, and the model in which the mean is used to predict \\(y\\) (called the intercept-only model). If you can reject the null hypothesis in the \\(F\\) test, then you know that using the regression to predict \\(y\\) at each \\(x\\) is an improvement over using the mean of \\(y\\) to predict \\(y\\) at each \\(x\\), and that the improvement is statistically significant. Formulating the Hypotheses: There is only one form of hypotheses, but the number of \\(\\beta&#39;s\\) in it depends on how many IVs you have in your regression model. Hypotheses about the Overall Significance of the Regression Model \\[H_{0}:\\ \\beta_{1} = \\beta_{2} = \\ldots = \\beta_{p} = 0\\] \\[H_{A}:\\ One\\ or\\ more\\ of\\ the\\ \\beta^{&#39;}\\text{s\\ is\\ not\\ zero}\\] Answers the question: Whether the population slope coefficients are jointly different from zero. That is to say, whether the regression model considered as a whole is statistically significant. The Test Statistic: The test statistic is: \\[F_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{\\text{MSR}}{\\text{MSE}}\\] \\[\\text{MSR} = the\\ Mean\\ Square\\ due\\ to\\ Regression\\] with (numerator) degrees of freedom \\(df_{1} = p\\) \\[\\text{MSE} = the\\ Mean\\ Square\\ Error\\] with (denominator) degrees of freedom \\(df_{2} = n - p - 1\\) \\[{\\text{where\\ n} = the\\ number\\ of\\ observations }{p = the\\ number\\ of\\ independent\\ variables}\\] Deciding whether or not to Reject \\(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{0}}\\): ANOVAs are always one-tailed, upper tail tests.

NOTE: this \\(\\mathbf{ p}\\text{-}\\mathbf{\\text{value}}\\) is reported by Excel in the Regression Output as Significance F in the ANOVA table!! Critical Value Approach: If \\(F _{\\text{test}} \\geq F_{\\alpha}\\), then reject \\(H_{0}\\)and accept \\(H_{A}\\).

["how-to-handle-insignificant-xs.html", "How to handle insignificant x’s", " How to handle insignificant x’s In multiple regression, the population slopes are estimated using all of the x’s at once. The procedure takes into account each x’s relationship with y, while simultaneously accounting for each x’s relationship to all the other x’s. Here’s what I mean, conceptually speaking: The upshot of all of this is that a couple of our interpretations have to change to acknowledge the fact that the other x’s are being accounted for. Other than that, things stay pretty much the same. Example: Showtime Theaters An analyst at Showtime Theaters has been asked to analyze the relationship between weekly on-line advertising ($1000s), weekly television advertising ($1000s), and weekly gross revenue ($1000s) What is the Dependent Variable? (in other words, what is being explained?) What are the Independent Variables? (in other words, what variables might explain changes in the dependent variable? Note: all of the variables are expressed in thousands of dollars. Regression calculates the estimated regression equation in the same units as the variables. This means that you have to consider the units when interpreting the slopes, when plugging x values into the ERE to make predictions, and when interpreting predicted values. The equation will expect x values in the same units as the data, and will produce y values in the same units as the data. 15 weeks are randomly selected. Weekly on-line advertising ($1000s), weekly television advertising ($1000s), and weekly gross revenue ($1000s) are measured. This analysis will use an \\(\\mathbf{\\alpha = 0.01}\\) significance level Here is the dataset: Week \\(i\\) Weekly Revenue \\[(y_{i})\\] TV Advertising \\[(x_{1_{i}})\\] On-line Advertising \\[(x_{2_{i}})\\] 1 97.92 5 1.5 2 95.94 4 1.5 3 93.8 2.5 2.5 4 95.31 3 3.3 5 94.62 3.5 2 6 94.63 2.5 4.2 7 94.64 3.2 2 8 93.47 2.2 4 9 97.73 4.6 3 10 96.3 4.25 2.6 11 95.6 3.9 1.7 12 94.46 3.3 1.8 13 93.01 2.7 2.25 14 93.07 2.75 1.2 15 95.25 3.4 3.1 Now we need to scatterplot y versus each x to look for non-linear patterns. \\[CHART\\] \\[CHART\\] SUMMARY OUTPUT Regression Statistics Multiple R 0.9745 R Square 0.9497 Adjusted R Square 0.9413 NOTE: all numbers have been rounded to Standard Error 0.3618 four decimal places.

What is the estimated regression equation (ERE)? Do the hypothesis test to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between TV Advertising and Revenue. Do the hypothesis test to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between On-line Advertising and Revenue. Do the hypothesis test to determine whether the overall regression model is statistically significant (See Ch 15: Handout #2) Now that we have confirmed this regression reflects real relationships in the population, we can go ahead and start using the results.

Note: the problem gives the spending in $s, but the Estimated Regression Equation is calculated using data in $1000s. So you must convert the $s to $1000s: \\(x_{1} = \\frac{\\$ 3750}{\\$ 1000} = 3.75\\ and\\ x_{2} = \\frac{\\$ 2300}{\\$ 1000} = 2.3\\) plug the x-values into the ERE: \\(\\widehat{y} = 87.0304 + 1.9365\\left( 3.75 \\right) + 0.5980\\left( 2.3 \\right) = 95.67\\) Interpretation: For all weeks in which TV Advertising is $3750 and On-line Advertising is $2300, Gross Weekly Revenue is predicted to be $95,670 on average. What is the interpretation of \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{,}\\) the slope coefficient on TV advertising? NOTE: for all interpretations, we should convert the $1000s to $s. If the units were already in $s, we would leave them alone, so here we multiply 1.9365 x $1000 = $1936.50. Interpretation: For every $1000 increase in TV Advertising, Gross Weekly Revenue is expected to increase by $1936.50 on average, holding On-line Advertising constant. What is the interpretation of \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{,}\\) the slope coefficient on On-line Advertising? (multiply 0.5980 x $1000 to convert to dollars) Interpretation: For every $1000 increase in On-line Advertising, Gross Weekly Revenue is expected to increase by $598 on average, holding TV Advertising constant. Uh-oh Interpret the Coefficient of Determination, \\(\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\) First, multiply \\(R^{2} = 0\\ .9497\\ \\times 100 = 94.97\\%\\) Interpretation: 94.97% of the variability in Gross Weekly Revenue is explained by TV Advertising and On-line Advertising Interpret the Standard Error of the Estimate, \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) \\(s = 0.3618\\) Again, it helps communicate this interpretation if you convert \\(s\\), which is in $1000s, to $s: \\(0.3618 \\times \\$ 1000 = \\$ 361.80\\) Interpretation: If we used the Estimated Regression Equation to predict Gross Weekly Revenue, our average error would be $361.80. Not bad! There ends our discussion of the Showtime Theaters regression. Moving on to other important issues… What about insignificant Independent Variables? So far, we have only dealt with models where all the IVs are significant. This is NOT always the case. If you do not reject the null hypothesis in a t-test for a slope coefficient, then you CANNOT conclude that the population slope on that x is different from zero. Therefore, you CANNOT conclude that the IV for that slope is related to the DV This may be a substantively interesting result. Was it an IV that you were certain would help explain the DV? You may need to investigate why it does not in this case. However, if you are using the model for prediction, then you should drop the insignificant IV from the analysis and re-estimate the regression model including only the significant IVs. Let’s look at an example: Cruise Ship Ratings Condé Nast Traveler magazine conducts an annual Reader’s Choice Survey in which they ask readers to rate small cruise ships on several criteria: Itineraries/Schedule, Shore Excursions, and Food/Dining. The readers also give an overall quality rating to each ship. The variable values represent the percentage of readers who rated the cruise ship excellent or very good on each criterion. Research question: which (or what combination) of the three criteria explain the overall rating? What is the DV? What are the IVs? Use an α = 0.05 significance level Here is the dataset: ShipID Ship Overall Score Itin eraries/ Schedule Shore Ex cursions Foo d/Dining 1 Seabourn Odyssey 94.4 94.6 90.9 97.8 2 Seabourn Pride 93 96.7 84.2 96.7 3 National Ge ographic Endeavor 92.9 100 100 88.5 4 Seabourn Sojourn 91.3 88.6 94.8 97.1 5 Paul Gauguin 90.5 95.1 87.9 91.2 6 Seabourn Legend 90.3 92.5 82.1 98.8 7 Seabourn Spirit 90.2 96 86.3 92 8 Silver Explorer 89.9 92.6 92.6 88.9 9 Silver Spirit 89.4 94.7 85.9 90.8 10 Seven Seas N avigator 89.2 90.6 83.3 90.5 11 Silver W hisperer 89.2 90.9 82 88.6 12 National Ge ographic Explorer 89.1 93.1 93.1 89.7 13 Silver Cloud 88.7 92.6 78.3 91.3 14 C elebrity X pedition 87.2 93.1 91.7 73.6 15 Silver Shadow 87.2 91 75 89.7 16 Silver Wind 86.6 94.4 78.1 91.6 17 SeaDream II 86.2 95.5 77.4 90.9 18 Wind Star 86.1 94.9 76.5 91.5 19 Wind Surf 86.1 92.1 72.3 89.3 20 Wind Spirit 85.2 93.5 77.4 91.9 \\[CHART\\] \\[CHART\\] \\[CHART\\] Here is the regression output: SUMMARY OUTPUT Regression Statistics Multiple R 0.865922 R Square 0.749821 Adjusted R Square 0.702912 Standard Error 1.387747 Observations 20 ANOVA df SS MS F Significance F Regression 3 92.35202 30.78401 15.9847 4.52E-05 Residual 16 30.81348 1.925843 Total 19 123.1655 Coefficients Standard Error t Stat P-value Lower 95% Upper 95% Intercept 35.61838 13.23083 2.692075 0.01603 7.570276 63.66648 Itineraries/Schedule 0.110454 0.129662 0.851859 0.406863 -0.16442 0.385325 Shore Excursions 0.244537 0.043357 5.64005 3.69E-05 0.152624 0.336451 Food/Dining 0.247357 0.062117 3.982137 0.001072 0.115675 0.379038 Is this model statistically significant overall?

["model-comparisons.html", "Model Comparisons", " Model Comparisons Frequently when using regression, we end up with more than one model for a particular dependent variable. We need some criteria to choose between models in that situation. \\(\\text{Adjusted~R}^{2}\\ \\)for model comparisons: When comparing two models that explain the same DV, it is tempting to choose the one with the higher Coefficient of Determination (\\(R^{2}\\)), but this would NOT be the right thing to do. \\(R^{2}\\) increases if you add additional IVs, even if the new variables do not add any substantive explanatory power to the model. \\(\\mathbf{\\text{Adjusted~}}\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{A}}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\), is modified to account for the number of IVs in the model. It only increases if the added variables improve the model more than would be expected to happen by chance. Therefore, \\(\\text{Adjusted~}R^{2}\\) is a useful statistic to compare two models. The one with the HIGHER \\(\\mathbf{\\text{Adjusted~}}\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\) is BETTER.
