<h2>Type I and Type II Error</h2>
<p>We use inferences based on probability to make decisions in hypothesis
testing. Basing decisions on probability, and not certainty, introduces
the possibility of error – that is, of making incorrect inferences and
drawing incorrect conclusions. These are NOT errors in calculation or
process – these errors are inherent in hypothesis testing, even if you
do everything right.</p>
<p>Two types of error in hypothesis testing:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Type I Error:</strong> Rejecting the null hypothesis (and
accepting the alternative hypothesis), when the null hypothesis is
actually true.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type II Error:</strong> Not rejecting the null hypothesis,
when the null hypothesis is actually false.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These errors have direct, real-world consequences. If you are testing
whether a new program has decreased costs, and a Type I error occurs,
then you would conclude that the program decreased costs when it
actually had not done so. This could lead your company to prolong an
ineffective program. On the other hand, consider the kettlebell
hypothesis test we did on Handout #4. In that test we did not reject
the null hypotheses, and so we concluded that there was no reason to
shut down the manufacturing line. If a Type II error had occurred in
that situation, then we would have let the line continue when actually
the population mean weight of the bells was not 20lbs, thus leading us
to ship product that did not conform to our 20lb specification.</p>
<p>This is why hypothesis testing should be done while considering other
information and context if at all possible. If a single hypothesis test
yields an unexpected result, then another sample should be taken and the
test should be repeated. It is highly unlikely that two Type I or Type
II errors would occur in successive samples from the same population.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\alpha}\)</span> <strong>significance level</strong> in a hypothesis test gives <strong>the
probability of making a Type I error</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do a hypothesis test at the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .01\)</span> significance
level, you have a 0.01 probability (in other words, a 1% chance) of
rejecting a null hypothesis that is actually true. To restate that,
1% of the time, a Type I error will happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>A shampoo company has introduced a new formula of a particular shampoo.
In the past, customers have been regularly surveyed about the shampoo,
asked to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 10, and the shampoo has
scored a mean of 6.2.</p>
<p>An analyst at the company would like to test whether the mean
satisfaction score changed after the new formula was introduced.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_{0}: \mu = 6.2 \\
H_{A}: \mu \neq 6.2\]</span></p>
<p>Suppose the analyst did this hypothesis test and, based on the sample,
rejected <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. However, in reality the population mean customer
satisfaction score is 6.2 (i.e. a value that makes the Null Hypothesis
true), this would be a Type I Error.</p>
<p>If the analyst did a hypothesis test and did not reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, but in
reality the actual population mean customer satisfaction score was 5.1
(i.e. a value that means the Null Hypothesis is not true), this would be
a Type II Error.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>A human resources manager is interested in testing the effectiveness of
a new training program. Prior to the training, employees could handle an
average of 11.65 cases per day. The HR manager would like to determine
whether the training has increased the average number of cases employees
can handle per work day.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_{0}:\\ H_{A}:\]</span></p>
<p>If the HR manager did a hypothesis test and did not reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, but
the actual population mean of cases per day was 12, what type of error
would this be?</p>
<p>What if the actual population mean was 11, and the HR manager rejected
the null hypothesis?</p>
<p>What if the HR manager rejected the null hypothesis based on the sample,
and the true population mean was 12.8?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>A manufacturer makes test tubes for laboratory use. These test tubes
must hold exactly 10 milliliters (ml) of liquid. If the production line
goes out of adjustment, then it may produce test tubes that are on
average too large or too small. A quality control analyst would like to
check whether the production line is running properly.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_{0}:\\ H_{A}:\]</span></p>
<p>What if the analyst rejected the null hypothesis based on the sample,
and the true population mean was actually 10 ml?</p>
<p>What if the analyst rejected the null hypothesis based on the sample,
and the true population mean was actually 10.06?</p>
<p>What if the analyst did not reject the null hypothesis, and the true
population mean was actually 10ml?</p>
