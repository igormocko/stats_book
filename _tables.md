<center> **How to Interpret an ANOVA**

| **When you** | **Interpretation** | 
|:---:|-----|
| **Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that not all of the population means are equal. Could also be stated: At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that at least one of the populations has a different mean than the others. |
| **Do not reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that any of the population means are different from one another. |
    
    
**NOTES:**    
1. When $H_0$  is rejected, you can then perform comparisons of pairs of means from the ANOVA to determine which one is different (or which ones are different)
