How to Interpret a Hypothesis Test about the Difference between Two Population Proportions, $\mathbf{p_1 - p_2}$**
</center>

| **When you** | **For a Lower Tail Test** | **For an Upper Tail Test** | **For a Two-Tailed Test** |
|:-:|----|----|----|
| **Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that $p_1$  is less than $p_2$. | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that $p_1$  is greater than $p_2$. |  At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that $p_1$  is different from $p_2$. |
**Do not reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that $p_1$  is less than $p_2$. | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that $p_1$  is greater than $p_2$. | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that $p_1$  is different from $p_2$. |
    
    
**NOTES:**    
$p_1$  is the true value of the proportion of population 1  
$p_2$ is the true value of the proportion of population 2
