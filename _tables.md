<center> **How to Interpret a Goodness-of-Fit Test**
</center>

| **When you** | **Interpretation** | 
|:---:|-----|
| **Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that *Variable 1* is not independent of *Variable 2*. *Variable 1* and *Variable 2* are related. |
| **Do not reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that *Variable 1* and *Variable 2* are related. |
    
    
**NOTES:**    
When $H_0$  is rejected, you can:  
1) look at the distribution of outcomes in the sample for information about the relationship between *Variable 1* and *Variable 2*  
2) compare the expected frequencies to the observed frequencies to learn about how the two variables are related.

| **Answers questions about:**                                         |
| Whether at least one group has a different mean than the others.     |
