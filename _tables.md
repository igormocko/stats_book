| **When you** | **Interpretation** | 
|:----:|----|
| **Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we can conclude that the probability distribution of *the variable* is NOT $p_1 = P_1, p_2 = P_2, ..., p_k = P_k$. |
| **Do not reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | At the $\alpha$ significance level, we cannot conclude that the probability distribution of *the variable* is different from $p_1 = P_1, p_2 = P_2, ..., p_k = P_k$. |
    
    
**NOTES:**    
1. When $H_0$  is rejected, you can then look at the distribution of outcomes in the sample for information about the true population distribution.
2. Comparing the expected frequencies to the observed frequencies is often helpful to learn about how the actual distribution differs from the $H_0$ distribution.
