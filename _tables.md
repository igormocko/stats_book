| **Reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | This result can be interpreted two ways. Choose the interpretation that is appropriate in the context of the problem: <br><br> 1. At the α significance level, we can conclude that $\sigma_1^2$  is greater than $\sigma_2^2$. <br><br> 2. At the α significance level, we can conclude that $\sigma_2^2$  is less than $\sigma_1^2$. | At the α significance level, we can conclude that $\sigma_1^2$  is different than $\sigma_2^2$. |
**Do not reject $\mathbf{H_0}$** | This result can be interpreted two ways. Choose the interpretation that is appropriate in the context of the problem: <br><br> 1. At the α significance level, we cannot conclude that $\sigma_1^2$  is greater than $\sigma_2^2$. <br><br> 2. At the α significance level, we cannot conclude that $\sigma_2^2$  is less than $\sigma_1^2$. | At the α significance level, we cannot conclude that $\sigma_1^2$  is different than $\sigma_2^2$. | 
    
    
**NOTES:**    
  1. $\mu_1$ is the true value of the mean of population 1  
     $\mu_2$ is the true value of the mean of population 2   
  2. $D_0$ is the hypothesized difference between the two population means, $\mu_1 - \mu_2$
