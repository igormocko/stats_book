## Multiple Regression {-}

Multiple regression models the relationship between one dependent
variable, $y$, and [two or more]{.underline} independent variables
(IVs), which we will notate $x_{1},x_{2},\ x_{3},\ldots,\ x_{p}.$ (Note:
here the subscripts on the $x$'s signify different independent
variables, not individual observations of$\text{\ x}$.) So, multiple
regression is linear regression with more than one independent variable.
Everything we have learned in Simple Linear Regression applies to
Multiple Regression as well, because Simple Linear Regression is just
the special case of multiple regression in which there is only one $x$.

The **Regression Model** describes the relationship between the DV and
the IVs [in the population]{.underline}, and it is given by the
following equation:

$$y = \ \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \ \beta_{2}x_{2} + \ldots + \ \beta_{p}x_{p} + \ \epsilon$$

> where

$${y = the\ dependent\ variable
}{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,\ x_{p} = the\ independent\ variables
}{\beta_{0} = the\ population\ intercept
}{\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\ldots\ ,\ \beta_{p} = the\ population\ slopes,which\ are\ the\ coefficients\ on\ the\ x\text{'}\text{s\ }
}{\epsilon = random\ error
}{p = the\ number\ of\ independent\ variables}$$

The betas, ($\beta_{0},\beta_{1},\ \beta_{2},\ \ldots,\ \beta_{p}$), are
population parameters. In other words, they are characteristics of the
population as a whole, and so we cannot know their values without
observing the entire population. When using regression, we take a random
sample from the population of interest and we use that sample to
estimate these parameters (the betas). That process results in the
***estimated regression equation (ERE)*:**

$$\widehat{y} = \ b_{0} + \ b_{1}x_{1} + \ b_{2}x_{2} + \ldots + \ b_{p}x_{p}$$

> where

$${\widehat{y} = the\ expected\ or\ predicted\ value\ of\ y\ (the\ mean\ of\ y)
}{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,\ x_{p} = the\ independent\ variables
}{b_{0} = the\ sample\ intercept;the\ estimate\ of\ \beta_{0}
}{b_{1},\ b_{2},\ldots,b_{p} = the\ sample\ slopes,which\ are\ the\ coefficients\ on\ the\ x^{'}s;\ }$$

$${\text{the\ }b^{'}\text{s\ are\ the\ estimates\ of\ }\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\ldots,\ \beta_{p}
}{p = the\ number\ of\ independent\ variables}$$

Multiple regression is based on the idea that the relationship between
$y$ and each $x$ is linear, so you still must examine the scatterplot of
$y$ against each $x$ to check for non-linear patterns. If you see
non-linear patterns, you cannot use linear regression to model the
relationship without modifying the variables to make the relationship
linear (techniques for this exist, but are beyond the scope of this
class).

The equations to calculate the coefficients in multiple regression
require calculus or matrix algebra, so we will not be calculating these
by hand. Instead, we will use Excel to produce output for multiple
regression and interpret that output. See **Chapter 14: Handout \#3 --
Interpreting Linear Regression Output** which includes interpretations
for Multiple Regression as well as Simple Linear Regression.

## Hypothesis Testing for Significance in Multiple Regression {-}

The **Regression Model**,
$\mathbf{y =}\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{+ \ }\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{+ \ldots +}\mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{p}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{p}}\mathbf{+ \epsilon}$,
gives the relationship between $\text{y\ }$and the $x's$ in the
[population]{.underline}. From the sample, regression calculates the
**Estimated Regression Equation (ERE)**,
$\widehat{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{+ \ldots +}\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{p}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{p}}$,
which gives the relationship between $\text{y\ }$and the $x^{'}s$ in the
[sample]{.underline}.

**[Hypothesis Tests About the Population Slopes]{.underline}**

Each population slope gives the relationship between its corresponding
$x$ and $y$. The following table summarizes the possible relationships
between $\text{x\ }$and $y:$

  **Slope Coefficient**   **Relationship between** $\mathbf{\text{x\ }}$**and** $\mathbf{y}$
  ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
  $$If\ \beta > 0$$       Positive linear relationship
  $$If\ \beta < 0$$       Negative linear relationship
  $$If\ \beta = 0$$       No relationship

In order to conclude that there [is]{.underline} a relationship between
a given $\text{x\ }$and $y,$ we need to confirm that the population
slope coefficient on that $x$ does not equal zero. In **Chapter 14:
Handout \#2**, we learned that we can use a two-tailed $t$ test to
confirm whether the population slope is different from zero. In multiple
regression, we use that same procedure on *each* slope coefficient in
turn.

So, to confirm whether there is a relationship between $x_{1}$ and $y$,
the hypotheses would be:

$$H_{0}:\ \beta_{1} = 0$$

$$H_{A}:\ \beta_{1} \neq 0$$

If $H_{0}$ is rejected and $H_{A}$ is accepted, then there is a
relationship between $x_{1}$ and $\text{y.}$ In other words, the
relationship between $x_{1}$ and $y$ is statistically significant.

Then, to confirm whether there is a relationship between $x_{2}$ and
$y$, the hypotheses would be:

$$H_{0}:\ \beta_{2} = 0$$

$$H_{A}:\ \beta_{2} \neq 0$$

If $H_{0}$ is rejected and $H_{A}$ is accepted, then there is a
relationship between $x_{2}$ and $\text{y.}$ In other words, the
relationship between $x_{2}$ and $y$ is statistically significant.

.

.

.

Finally, to confirm whether there is a relationship between $x_{p}$ and
$y$, the hypotheses would be:

$$H_{0}:\ \beta_{p} = 0$$

$$H_{A}:\ \beta_{p} \neq 0$$

If $H_{0}$ is rejected and $H_{A}$ is accepted, then there is a
relationship between $x_{p}$ and $\text{y.}$ In other words, the
relationship between $x_{p}$ and $y$ is statistically significant.

Each slope coefficient must be tested separately. Luckily for us, Excel
calculates the $t_{\text{test}}$ test statistic and two-tailed p-value
for each slope coefficient and reports them in the regression output. We
just need to compare the p-value to $\alpha$ in each case. If the
p-value $\leq \ \alpha$, then we reject $H_{0}$ and conclude there is a
statistically significant relationship between the particular $x$ and
$y$.

Remember: when the null hypothesis is rejected in these hypothesis
tests, the conclusion is that the relationship between the given $x$ and
$y$ is *statistically significant*.

**[Hypothesis Test for the Overall Significance of the Regression
Model]{.underline}**

The $F$ test reported in the ANOVA table in the regression output tests
the overall significance of the regression model. It tests whether the
model *considered as a whole* is significant. Whereas the $t$ tests
discussed above test for the significance of the relationship between
each individual $x$ and $y$ separately, the $F$ test shows whether $y$
is related to the $\text{set\ of\ all\ }x^{'}s$, considered together.

Technically speaking, the $F$ test compares two different models for
predicting $y:$ the regression model, and the model in which the mean is
used to predict $y$ (called the intercept-only model). If you can reject
the null hypothesis in the $F$ test, then you know that using the
regression to predict $y$ at each $x$ is an improvement over using the
mean of $y$ to predict $y$ at each $x$, and that the improvement is
statistically significant.

## How to handle insignificant x's {-}

In multiple regression, the population slopes are estimated using all of
the x's at once. The procedure takes into account each x's relationship
with y, while simultaneously accounting for each x's relationship to all
the other x's. Here's what I mean, conceptually speaking:

The upshot of all of this is that a couple of our interpretations have
to change to acknowledge the fact that the other x's are being accounted
for. Other than that, things stay pretty much the same.

**[Example: Showtime Theaters]{.underline}**

An analyst at Showtime Theaters has been asked to analyze the
relationship between weekly on-line advertising (\$1000s), weekly
television advertising (\$1000s), and weekly gross revenue (\$1000s)

-   What is the Dependent Variable? (in other words, what is being
    explained?)

-   What are the Independent Variables? (in other words, what variables
    might explain changes in the dependent variable?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Note: all of the variables are expressed in thousands of dollars.
    Regression calculates the estimated regression equation in the same
    units as the variables. This means that you have to consider the
    units when interpreting the slopes, when plugging x values into the
    ERE to make predictions, and when interpreting predicted values. The
    equation will expect x values in the same units as the data, and
    will produce y values in the same units as the data.

```{=html}

```
-   15 weeks are randomly selected. Weekly on-line advertising
    (\$1000s), weekly television advertising (\$1000s), and weekly gross
    revenue (\$1000s) are measured.

-   This analysis will use an $\mathbf{\alpha = 0.01}$ significance
    level

What is the Regression Model we are estimating here?

What is the estimated regression equation (ERE)?

Do the hypothesis test to determine whether there is a statistically
significant relationship between TV Advertising and Revenue.

Do the hypothesis test to determine whether there is a statistically
significant relationship between On-line Advertising and Revenue.

Do the hypothesis test to determine whether *the overall regression
model* is statistically significant (See **Ch 15: Handout \#2**)

**Now that we have confirmed this regression reflects real relationships
in the population, we can go ahead and start using the results.**

**Remember what the ERE was?**

$$\widehat{y} = 87.0304 + 1.9365x_{1} + 0.5980x_{2}$$

$$NOTE:\ \widehat{y} = predicted\ Gross\ Weekly\ Revenue\ \left( in\ \$ 1000s \right)$$

$$x_{1} = TV\ Advertising\ \left( in\ \$ 1000s \right)$$

$$x_{2} = On\text{-}\text{line~advertising~}\left( in\ \$ 1000s \right)$$

**What is the predicted Gross Weekly Revenue if \$3750 is spent on TV
Advertising and \$2300 is spent on On-line Advertising?**

-   Note: the problem gives the spending in \$s, but the Estimated
    Regression Equation is calculated using data in \$1000s. So you must
    convert the \$s to \$1000s:
    $x_{1} = \frac{\$ 3750}{\$ 1000} = 3.75\ and\ x_{2} = \frac{\$ 2300}{\$ 1000} = 2.3$

-   *plug the x-values into the ERE:*
    $\widehat{y} = 87.0304 + 1.9365\left( 3.75 \right) + 0.5980\left( 2.3 \right) = 95.67$

-   **Interpretation:** For all weeks in which TV Advertising is \$3750
    and On-line Advertising is \$2300, Gross Weekly Revenue is predicted
    to be \$95,670 on average.

**What is the interpretation of** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{,}$
**the slope coefficient on TV advertising?**

-   NOTE: for all interpretations, we should convert the \$1000s to \$s.
    If the units were already in \$s, we would leave them alone, so here
    we multiply 1.9365 x \$1000 = \$1936.50.

-   **Interpretation:** For every \$1000 increase in TV Advertising,
    Gross Weekly Revenue is expected to increase by \$1936.50 on
    average, holding On-line Advertising constant.

**What is the interpretation of** $\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{,}$
**the slope coefficient on On-line Advertising?** *(multiply 0.5980 x
\$1000 to convert to dollars)*

-   **Interpretation:** For every \$1000 increase in On-line
    Advertising, Gross Weekly Revenue is expected to increase by \$598
    on average, holding TV Advertising constant.

-   Uh-oh

**Interpret the Coefficient of Determination,**
$\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$

-   First, multiply $R^{2} = 0\ .9497\  \times 100 = 94.97\%$

-   **Interpretation:** 94.97% of the variability in Gross Weekly
    Revenue is explained by TV Advertising and On-line Advertising

**Interpret the Standard Error of the Estimate,** $\mathbf{s}$

-   $s = 0.3618$

-   Again, it helps communicate this interpretation if you convert $s$,
    which is in \$1000s, to \$s: $0.3618 \times \$ 1000 = \$ 361.80$

-   **Interpretation:** If we used the Estimated Regression Equation to
    predict Gross Weekly Revenue, our average error would be \$361.80.
    Not bad!

There ends our discussion of the Showtime Theaters regression. Moving on
to other important issues...

**[What about insignificant Independent Variables?]{.underline}**

-   So far, we have only dealt with models where all the IVs are
    significant. This is NOT always the case.

-   If you do not reject the null hypothesis in a t-test for a slope
    coefficient, then you CANNOT conclude that the population slope on
    that x is different from zero. Therefore, you CANNOT conclude that
    the IV for that slope is related to the DV

    -   This may be a substantively interesting result. Was it an IV
        that you were certain would help explain the DV? You may need to
        investigate why it does not in this case.

    -   However, if you are using the model for prediction, then you
        should drop the insignificant IV from the analysis and
        re-estimate the regression model including only the significant
        IVs.

Let's look at an example:

[Cruise Ship Ratings]{.underline}

-   *Condé Nast Traveler* magazine conducts an annual Reader's Choice
    Survey in which they ask readers to rate small cruise ships on
    several criteria: Itineraries/Schedule, Shore Excursions, and
    Food/Dining. The readers also give an overall quality rating to each
    ship.

    -   The variable values represent the percentage of readers who
        rated the cruise ship excellent or very good on each criterion.

-   Research question: which (or what combination) of the three criteria
    explain the overall rating?

-   What is the DV? What are the IVs?

-   Use an α = 0.05 significance level

**Is this model statistically significant overall?**

(remember, we are using α = 0.05)

-   The F test statistic has p-value = 0.0000452

    -   0.0000452 ≤ 0.05, so we would reject $H_{0}$ in the F test. YES,
        the overall model is statistically significant.

**Going from the bottom of the Coefficients Table up, is each IV
statistically significant?**

-   Food/Dining: p-value = 0.001072

    -   0.001072 ≤ 0.05, so we would reject $H_{0}$ in the t-test for
        $\beta_{3}$. YES, Food/Dining has a statistically significant
        relationship with Overall Score.

-   Shore Excursions: p-value = 0.0000369

    -   0.0000369 ≤ 0.05, so we would reject $H_{0}$ in the t-test for
        $\beta_{2}$. YES, Shore Excursions has a statistically
        significant relationship with Overall Score.

-   What about Itineraries/Schedules? p-value = 0.406863

    -   Uh-oh! 0.406863 \> 0.05, so we would **not** reject $H_{0}$ in
        the t-test for $\beta_{1}$. NO, Itineraries/Schedule does NOT
        have statistically significant relationship with Overall Score.

We assume this model is being used for prediction purposes, so we should
drop the Itineraries/Schedule variable by going into Excel and
re-running the regression with only Food/Dining and Shore Excursions
included in the x variable range. Here are the results of that:

Now all the variables are statistically significant, and see how the
slopes changed? Even though Itineraries/Schedule was not statistically
significant, it was still messing up the estimates for the other slopes.

## Model Comparisons {-}

Frequently when using regression, we end up with more than one model for
a particular dependent variable. We need some criteria to choose between
models in that situation.

$\text{Adjusted~R}^{2}\ $*[for model comparisons:]{.underline}*

-   When comparing two models that explain the same DV, it is tempting
    to choose the one with the higher Coefficient of Determination
    ($R^{2}$), but this would **NOT** be the right thing to do. $R^{2}$
    increases if you add additional IVs, even if the new variables do
    not add any substantive explanatory power to the model.

-   $\mathbf{\text{Adjusted~}}\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$,
    $\mathbf{R}_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{2}}$, is modified to account for
    the number of IVs in the model. It only increases if the added
    variables improve the model more than would be expected to happen by
    chance. Therefore, $\text{Adjusted~}R^{2}$ is a useful statistic to
    compare two models. The one with the **HIGHER**
    $\mathbf{\text{Adjusted~}}\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$ is **BETTER**.
    (NOTE: $\text{Adjusted~}R^{2}$ is NOT interpretable like $R^{2}$
    is.)

    -   $\text{Adjusted~}R^{2} = \ R_{A}^{2} = 1 - \left\lbrack \left( 1 - R^{2} \right)\left( \frac{n\  - 1}{n\  - p\  - 1} \right) \right\rbrack$

$$where\ n = \#\ of\ observations\ and\ p = \#\ of\ IVs$$

*[Standard Error of the Estimate,]{.underline}* $s$*[, for model
comparisons:]{.underline}*

-   Reminder: the Standard Error of the Estimate, $s$, is the average
    error we would make when using the estimated regression equation to
    predict the DV.

-   Two models with the same DV measured in the same units can be
    compared using s. The one with the **LOWER** **s** gives more
    accurate predictions, and therefore is the **BETTER** model.

*[Illustration of this:]{.underline}*

Here is a summary table of some statistics from the two cruise ship
regressions (one with all three IVs, one with only the two significant
IVs):

+------------------------------------------+---------------+--------------+
|                                          | **Model 1:**  | **Model 2:** |
|                                          |               |              |
|                                          | **Three IVs** | **Two IVs**  |
+==========================================+===============+==============+
| Coefficient of Determination ${(R}^{2})$ | 0.7498        | 0.7385       |
+------------------------------------------+---------------+--------------+
| Adjusted $R^{2}\ (R_{A}^{2})$            | 0.7029        | 0.7077       |
+------------------------------------------+---------------+--------------+
| Standard Error of the Estimate (s)       | 1.3877        | 1.3765       |
+------------------------------------------+---------------+--------------+

-   $\text{Adjusted~R}^{2}$ is useful for model comparisons. It is not
    affected by additional IVs like $R^{2}$ is. **HIGHER values of**
    $\mathbf{\text{Adjusted~}}\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$ **are BETTER**,
    so **Model 2** is better than Model 1

-   The Standard Error of the Estimate (*s*) gives the average error
    made when using the regression equation to predict the DV. The lower
    the *s*, the more accurate the predictions are. When comparing two
    models, **LOWER values of the Standard Error of the Estimate are
    BETTER**. So, **Model 2** is better than Model 1
