[Hypotheses about a Single Population Proportion]{.underline}

Another population parameter we may be interested in is a [population
proportion,]{.underline} $p$.

The first concern when dealing with problems about proportions is that
proportions are commonly expressed in words as *percentages*, *shares*,
or *fractions*. Regardless of how they are expressed in words, they
**must** be converted into mathematical proportions before using them in
hypothesis testing. Proportions are always between 0 and 1.

To convert a percentage to a proportion, divide the percentage by 100.
If a proportion is expressed as a fraction, divide out the fraction to
obtain a decimal. A proportion may be expressed as a share, such as 25
out of 72. To convert a share to a proportion, calculate the relative
frequency: $\frac{25}{72} = 0.3472.$

*Example 1*: *Converting a percentage to a proportion*

97% of the people in Michigan live in the Lower Peninsula. What
proportion of people in Michigan live in the Lower Peninsula?

-   *Answer:* 97% is a percentage. To convert it to a proportion, divide
    97 by 100: $p = \frac{97}{100} = \mathbf{0.97}$

*Example 2: Converting a share to a proportion*

A random sample of 38 customers was taken. 23 preferred Brand A. What
proportion of customers preferred Brand A? Round to 4 decimal places,
and recall that a sample proportion is notated $\overline{p}.$

-   *Answer:* This proportion is expressed as a share: 23 out of 38
    customers prefer Brand A. To convert it to a proportion, divide the
    number of customers who prefer Brand A by the total number of
    customers: $\overline{p} = \frac{23}{38} = \ \mathbf{0.6053}$

*Example 3*: *Converting a fraction to a proportion*

1/5 of people prefer oranges to apples. What proportion of people prefer
oranges to apples?

-   *Answer:* This proportion is expressed as a fraction. To convert it
    to a proportion, divide it out: $p = \frac{1}{5} = \mathbf{0.2}$

For the following exercises, formulate the hypotheses
$\left( H_{0}\text{\ and\ }H_{A} \right)\ $and be sure to express
$p_{0}$ correctly as a proportion:

*Exercise 1*:

An optician reads an article that states that industry-wide, 3 in 10
customers rate new glasses as "unsatisfactory". This optician would like
to find out if the proportion of his customers who would say the same is
lower than the industry-wide proportion. Formulate the null and
alternative hypotheses the optician should use.

*Exercise 2*:

A manufacturer suspects that a new plant produces a proportion of
defective parts that is different from the other plants. At the other
plants, the percentage of defective parts is 5.9%. What are the null and
alternative hypotheses the company should use to test whether the
population proportion of defective parts at the new plant differs from
5.9%?

*Exercise 3:*

Suppose that in 2012, 3/5 of people preferred to write in pen rather
than pencil. What null and alternative hypotheses should you use to
determine whether the proportion of people who prefer to write in pen
has increased?
