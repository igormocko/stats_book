## Hypothesis Testing: The Process

A [hypothesis test]{.underline} occurs in stages.

The logic of hypothesis testing is as follows:

1)  Identify a population of interest, a parameter of interest, and a
    question you have about that parameter

2)  Make an assumption about the value of the population parameter you
    are interested in

3)  Examine a random sample from the population to see if it contradicts
    that assumption

4)  If the sample contradicts the assumption, then reject the
    assumption. Otherwise, do not reject the assumption. (NOTE: you can
    never prove that the assumption is true in a hypothesis test -- you
    can only prove that it is wrong. Hence: "Reject," or "Do not
    reject")

5)  Answer the original question.

In practice, these are the steps in a **hypothesis test**, in which you
use a sample to infer information about the value of a population
parameter:

1)  **Formulate a null hypothesis**
    $\mathbf{(}\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{)}$ **and an alternative
    hypothesis** $\mathbf{(}\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{)}$ according
    to the question you want to answer about the population parameter of
    interest. The null hypothesis is an assumption about the value of
    the population parameter; the alternative hypothesis is the
    mathematical opposite of the null hypothesis.

2)  **Calculate the Test-Statistic.** In this step, you standardize
    information from the sample against the appropriate sampling
    distribution.

3)  **Decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis.** Determine
    the probability of getting that Test-Statistic (in other words, that
    sample), assuming that the null hypothesis is true. If the
    probability is less than the $\alpha$ significance level, then
    reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
    Otherwise, do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the
    alternative hypothesis is unsupported.

4)  **Interpret the hypothesis test** in order to answer the original
    question.
