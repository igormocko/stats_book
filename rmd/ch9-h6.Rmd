[More Hypothesis Testing about a Single Population Mean]{.underline}

*Exercise 1:*

A cosmetics brand hired several Instagram influencers to post about
their makeup in an effort to boost sales. The mean of monthly sales
prior to hiring the influencers was \$11,000 per month per store. In
order to check whether sales are increasing, the company takes a sample
of 50 stores and measures monthly sales. The mean of the sample is
\$11,800, and the standard deviation of the sample is \$4500.

Perform and interpret a hypothesis test to find out if the population
mean sales have increased at an $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level.
